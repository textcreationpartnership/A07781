            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing willing (Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, and my very good Lorde) in the ſight of all the worlde, to leaue ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique teſtimonie of my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duetie &amp; vnfaigned good will towardes your Honor: I thought I coulde no better way performe it, then by dedicating theſe poore labours of mine to be ſhrowded and harboured vnder your good and fauourable protection. And albeit I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that my tranſlation is not worthie ſuch a Patrone, yet this I muſt needes ſay, that the worke it ſelfe, both in reſpect of the Aucthour that wrote it, and alſo of the matter, is worthy not onely of your Honors defence, but alſo of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of all noble men, yea of the greateſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the world, if they wil anſwere their calling, and holde of God to maintaine his Church and trueth, and will ſet greateſt price vpon thinges that are moſt precious. For concerning the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
<pb facs="tcp:7934:3"/>though I be not acquainted with his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet this is ſufficient, that I knowe him by his vertue, and by this excellent worke: who as he is a Gentleman of a noble houſe, and employed in waightie affaires, which ſufficiently commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his credite and wiſedome to the worlde, ſo, which is a thing to be marueiled at, amiddeſt all his buſineſſe, whileſt he lay here, he ſet forth this notable treatiſe, wherein he hath ſhewed ſuch learning and reading, with iudgement and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to the Church of God, as I knowe not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from a man of his place any hath euer bene more learnedly and piththily publiſhed, and that more may make to the edifying of the Church of God, and confuting the aduerſarie. The Lorde ſend many ſuch Ambaſſadours, that euermore their policie may be guided by diuinitie. And thus much both for the perſon and the worke. Nowe touching the tranſlation. In very deede, I haue therein ſtudied to be plaine &amp; ſimple, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping my ſelfe to mine Aucthour, both in wordes and meaning, ſo farre foorth as the proprietie of the tongue woulde ſuffer me. Wherefore (good my Lorde) I moſt humbly beſeech your Honor to accept this my humble and bounden duetie: and as by your Honor I dedicate it to the Church of England, ſo I humbly craue that it may be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: for hereunto is your Honor called of God, and therefore hath he giuen you your aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that you ſhoulde maintaine his Church, loue his religion, ſet your ſelfe againſt Poperie, and liue and die to his glorie. He hath honored you, that you ſhoulde honor him, and hath ſet you vp,
<pb facs="tcp:7934:3"/>that you ſhoulde maintaine him. And wholly to truſt in him, and to liue to him, is a ſtay that can neuer faile, neither in this worlde, nor in the worlde to come. All other things ſhall faile, for all fleſh is graſſe, and the glorie of man is as the flower of the fielde: but God is euerlaſting, his worde is euerlaſting, and they that are begotten to him by the immortall ſeede of his worde, ſhall liue for euer. And this life beginneth and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in vs, as we growe and encreaſe in the true knowledge of God, to the encreaſing of our faith, and working in vs, as the ſeale of our adoption, that true ſanctification, that maketh vs to liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God by righteouſneſſe, purely to worſhip him according to his worde: and with brotherly loue deuoyde of all hypocryſie, from a pure heart to loue our neighbours. This (my Lord) is true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whereunto as God in great mercie hath called your Honor, ſo goe cherefully forwarde: beware of this vaine worlde, and of that vaine truſt that wicked men are wont to put in it. Leane not vpon it, but ſtoppe your eares againſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunting and fawning whiſperings of hollowe harted Papiſts, and diſſolute profeſſors: for there can be no greater treſpaſſe againſt the Lord, then to leane vpon Aſſyria, to reſt in the ſtrength of Egypt, to goe downe into Ethiopia. Curſed is that man that putteth his truſt in man, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth fleſh his arme, he ſhalbe like the heath that groweth in the wilderneſſe: but contrariwiſe, he that truſteth in the Lord, mercie ſhall embrace him on euery ſide, he ſhall neuer be confounded, he ſhalbe as Mount Sion, and ſhall neuer be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued:
<pb facs="tcp:7934:4"/>For the Lord is his ſecrete place, and is with him, therefore who can be againſt him? what is a mans bowe? what are his legges? what is the ſwiftneſſe of Horſes, or the ſtrength of an hoaſte, or the fauour of all the princes of the worlde in compariſon of God, in whom is onely the aſſurance of that euerlaſting inheritance? It is the God of Iacob that muſt be our defence, our ſtrong tower and rocke, the Chariot and horſemen of Iſrael, the teſtimonie of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and fauour, that onely can make vs glad. Wherefore, againe and againe I moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech your Honor, beware of the vaine truſt &amp; confidence of men in men, and in things that are leſſe worth then men. And as God hath in mercie beſtowed vpon your Honor great wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſo pray that you may haue a diſcerning ſpirite, that the deceyueable glorie of your proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie and high aucthoritie, make you not forget your greateſt duetie: that you may ſhine in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes Church to the benefite of the whole body, defending Chriſt his poore members, to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of your power, and puniſhing all his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries: that Agag, vpon whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſentence, may not be ſpared, nor good Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie buffeted: that Michee may be preferred, yea though there be foure hundred falſe prophets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. O (my Lorde) God asketh this at your Honors hands, and this Church of England craues it, that his miniſterie may be mainteyned, his trueth may be preſerued and continued, the poore people may be taught and enſtructed, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked heretikes may be confuted and abondoned,
<pb facs="tcp:7934:4"/>which (alas) encreaſe and growe to infinite nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers dayly amongſt vs. For where through impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie men may profeſſe what they lyſt, and no tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and examination is had, according to God his worde: there is it any maruell if Papiſts, Arrians, Anabaptiſts, Libertines, and other heretikes of al ſortes doe dayly multiphe and encreaſe? Wil they not creepe in there, where they may haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt reſt and quietneſſe? Who ſeeth not that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the preaching of the Goſpel of Chriſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeeres, amiddeſt the great peace and bleſſings God in mercie hath beſtowed vpon vs, becauſe we haue bene negligent to anſwere our callings, to put in practiſe that we haue learned, with bringing foorth the fruites of faith and true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce, and making conſcience of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the Papiſts, thoſe enemies of God, and of her royall Maieſtie, are nowe more in nomber, more obſtinate and frowarde, more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious, then they were at her Maieſties moſt ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; happie entrance to her ſcepter &amp; crowne? Did not many more goe to Church, &amp; ſhew their conformitie (as they call it) ſixteene yeres agoe, then nowe? And whereto may all this be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but to impunitie, for that they haue beene winked at, fauoured, and ſpared? which with what meaning ſoeuer it hath bene done, yet how they haue profited thereby, al the worlde may ſee, and their treaſonable practiſes may ſufficiently wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.

Wherfore, if it ſhall pleaſe you to reade, you ſhall finde herein a little after, what ought to be the right condition of the Church of God, and what now at this preſent it is vnder the tyrannie of the Pope, in the Church of Rome, and conſequently, what honour God hath ſhewed vnto you in our time, chooſing you out from amongst ſo many great Princes, to deliuer it from ſuch a bondage. The world will make no accompt of theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: neither is it of the worlde.

This vndoubtedly is a great work, &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in verely there is much toile: for the word of God is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the nations and kinges of the earth for the most part, will bande themſelues together, to maintaine

                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD, through his might the Creatour of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, vouchſauing of his owne good wil, to be the Father thereof, would that the Church ſhould be honoured &amp; acknowledged as mother of all thoſe, of whom he vouchſaueth to be Father, in his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord: And foraſmuch as we are not ſaued, but in this that God hath allowed vs for his children, and that he hath allowed none to be ſuch, but thoſe that are regenerated, and nouriſhed vp in his Church: if we deſire our ſaluation, it is neceſſarie that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge her, in whoſe lappe we haue it. And if we will be heires of the Father, we muſt be vnited in the familie of the mother, in which it hath pleaſed him to beget thoſe againe, whom he hath ordeined to be hetres of his kingdome, and coheires of his deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>All they that are knit and incorporated into this Churche in true faith &amp; charitie, are partakers of this inheritance, becauſe they are members of the body of Chriſt: and without her, as there is no true fayth, nor charitie, nor Chriſt, ſo alſo we ought not to ſeeke any ſaluation, but in her. And therefore if a man would ſpeake properly, we ſhould call the Churche, a company onely of thoſe, whom God hath choſen to euerlaſting life, in al times &amp; places, which is to man inuiſible, who can not enter ſo farre as to knowe Gods will, neyther the hart of man himſelfe, but is only viſible to God,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.19.</note> who knoweth thoſe that are his (as the Apoſtle ſaith) &amp; hath ſealed them with his owne ſeale. Notwithſtanding, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as charitie hath commaunded vs to preſume particularlie of all thoſe that are called the Churche of Chriſt, that they are of the no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of his elect, &amp; that as they are bodily there aſſembled together, ſo alſo that they are there ſpiritually incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, albeit on the contrarie part the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of fayth generally teacheth vs, that the wicked to the end of the world, are min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
<pb facs="tcp:7934:11"/>with the good, the Goates with the Sheepe, the chaffe with the graine, &amp; the tares with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good corne: yet will we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit vnto God, the ſearcher of hartes, the knowledge of the inuiſible Church, &amp; will content our ſelues to ſearch for the viſible in his word, into which all they muſt retire themſelues in this world, which wil be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into the inuiſible Churche in the world to come.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, by the way we will note the differences that are betwene theſe two. The inuiſible Church co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taineth none but the good. The viſible Church contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth both the good and the bad, to witte, that onelye the electe, this all thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, which are brought into her by the preaching of the trueth. And for this cauſe S. Auguſtine ſaith of that,<note place="margin">Auguſt. vp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

The inuiſible Church is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:7934:12"/>conſidered in heauen, &amp; partly in earth, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehending aſwell thoſe which triumph already with their head Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, as thoſe which yet fight here beneath in the earth for his name, againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world &amp; againſt themſelues, &amp; which ſhal fight in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame church after vs. The viſible church is conſidered properly to conſiſt in them, who not onely fight here in earth for the name of Chriſt, but as well thoſe that fight vnder his name, with falſe markes &amp; ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derds &amp; enſignes. And for this cauſe, that is conſidered euen from the firſt faythfull vnto the laſt, bringing all the ſtates &amp; ages of the church into one: this according to certaine places &amp; times, foraſmuch as ſhe is not vniuerſally viſible (and to be ſeene) at one puſh, but according to the ages, and in her degrees. In the inuiſible, there is a great many ſheepe, which neuer were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into the viſible, and contrarywiſe in the viſible, a great many wolues which neuer ſhalbe receiued into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inuiſible. And therefore S. Auguſtine ſayth,<note place="margin">Auguſt. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. in Ioan. 45. &amp; ca. 20. lib. 5. de bapt. &amp;c. Rom. 9.6.</note> that there are a great many ſheepe without, and a great many woolues within: and S. Paul ſaith alſo they are not al Iſrael which are of
<pb facs="tcp:7934:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>Iſrael. For to be in the church, or rather to ſay, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, is to be vnited with Chriſt, &amp; incorporated in the company of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, through true faith towards God, and charitie towards our neighbor. And there is no doubt, but that many here and there vnder Paganiſme it ſelfe, had this deſire, which yet bodily they could not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, the which notwithſtanding they are bound to doe with all their power: as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe, to be ſeparated from the church, is not onely to be without the aſſemblie, but to haue no participation of Chriſt, nor vnion of faith and charitie with his fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Of the inuiſible it is ſayd,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. Mat. 24.11</note> that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gates of hell ſhal not preuaile againſt her. Of the viſible, that ſhe ſhalbe ſo troubled, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall not finde faith on the earth,<note place="margin">Luke. 8.8.</note> that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ſhalbe as it were quenched, inſomuch that the elect themſelues, if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſhould vtterly quaile. And therefore it is not without cauſe that we ſay in our Creede, that we beleeue the church. For if we ought to hold nothing for certaine, but that which we ſee with theſe carnall eyes, there is no dout, but that in all the ſtates &amp; ages of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, there ſhould many times
<pb facs="tcp:7934:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſuch a confuſion, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good graine ſhould be altogether hid vnder the chaffe, without any appearance of the Churche, and yet notwithſtanding this was then, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ſayd to Elias, that he had reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the ſame <hi>7000.</hi> whereof the chariot of Iſrael, the Seer of the Lord, I ſay, he to whom the good people ought eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to haue beene knowen, could not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly knowe one: and euen then &amp; there when the ſtate of the Church was ſuch, as God could not be ſerued viſiblye, but in Iewrie.</p>
               <p>All theſe differences notwithſtanding, we do not beleeue two Churches, nor two eſpouſes of Chriſt, but we beleeue one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye conſidered diuerſely: one in the blade, and the other in the graine, one in the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing floore, another in the garner, one in the mine, another now already fyned, the one inwrapped yet in the minglings of the world, the other before her huſband with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpotte or wrinckle. Altogether like as by a familie, we properly vnderſtand the children only, although ſpeaking more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally we comprehend the ſeruants them ſelues, &amp; by a Citie we vnderſtand the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>Returning then to our purpoſe we will call y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> viſible church, the company of thoſe, which make profeſſion to ſerue the true God in Chriſt, of which we haue preſently to intreate. This Church hath had three principall ſtates or ages, one without the lawe, then (ſay ſome of the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) when man was but in ſome ſort corrupted by the ſinne of the firſt, when he was notwithſtanding in ſome ſort a lawe to him ſelfe, &amp; naturally felt himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced of his ſinne, that is to ſay, he felt his euil, to ſeeke for remedy for the ſame: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in very trueth this ſtate and age of the Church, found it ſelfe no leſſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt. The ſecond was vnder the lawe, when it began in ſuch ſort to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome it ſelfe to ſinne, that it grewe into a natural habite through the ſame: and then for to ſhewe the ſinne therof, the lawe was giuen as a glaſſe, in which ſhe might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider her filthineſſe, and how farre of ſhe was from that ſhee preſumed, to the ende ſhe might returne again to be clenſed. The
<pb facs="tcp:7934:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>thirde was vnder grace, in Ieſus Chriſt promiſed to our firſt parents by &amp; by after their fal, and who, when the fulnes of time was come, was ſent of the Father, who brought remedy to all them, that before eyther had, or preſently did feele their euil, and ſought remedy in his merite. Vnder the firſt, the Church was viſible amongſt men, but if you compare thoſe which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued God in puritie, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the others, we ſhal finde that they were entangled in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull confuſion. Vnder the ſecond, the Church was viſible in one people, iſſued from the loynes of Abraham, to witte, the people of Iſrael, but not ſo eminent, if we conſider not ſo much what the countrie, as the people themſelues were, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the reſt of the whole world, and the great Empires that floriſhed at that time. Vnder the third, is comprehended all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples &amp; nations without any exception or acception whatſoeuer, being nowe viſible in one Countrey, or other, fewe or many, and therefore we call her Catholique, or vniuerſal, to witte, which is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

No more then when we ſpeake of ſome parts of the Ocean ſea, we call all thoſe the ſea, as the South ſea, the North ſea, the Athlantique ſea, the Cantabrique ſea, and the Britannique ſea, &amp;c. and we ſay of al theſe, it is the Ocean ſea. And yet notwithſtanding we knowe that there is but one Ocean, and not many, whereof by theſe names we make many diſtinctions, ſeeing it is but one body &amp; vniforme, from which the vnion cannot be ſeuered, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed, as wee ought alſo to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in the Church.

               <p>Nowe the viſible Church is in the worlde, and the worlde as we may feele in our ſelues, is an vncleane worlde, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore liuing vnder ſuch an infected ayre, it is impoſſible, but that ſhee ſhoulde be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and drawe vnto her much corruption. It is alſo compounded of men, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly gouerned by men, and all men are fleſh and blood, and by a conſequent cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and imperfect, ſubiect to ignorance and malice. It is then poſſible that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhee be corrupted, and impoſſible that in this world ſhe appeare in any ſound perfection. Notwithſtanding, becauſe the Scripture ſometymes in ſpeaking, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing regard to that which is reputed vnto her (in conſideration of Ieſus Chriſt her huſband) before God, and ſometimes alſo not according to that ſhe is, but according to that ſhee ought to be, not ſo much to praiſe her, as to prouoke her to make her ſelfe worthy of that praiſe, ſhee is graunted theſe titles of the Churche, to which ſhe is not alwayes conformed: be it that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb facs="tcp:7934:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>her in the men, whereof ſhe is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or the doctrine it ſelfe that is taught in her. She is called the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, or the kingdome of Chriſt:<note place="margin">Mat. 13.47</note> but Chriſt Ieſus, which is the king himſelf that raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in her, compareth her vnto a net caſt into the ſea, which draweth vp to him both good and bad fiſhe. This then is as much to ſay, as in this kingdome of heauen the deuill hath his ſubiects, which perteyne to his tyrannie. Saint Paul alſo there cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs the houſe of God,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.15.</note> and exhorteth vs to take heede howe we there behaue our ſelues: but the ſelfe ſame Paul would not hide this from vs,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.20.</note> that in the ſame houſe there are not onely veſſels of golde and of ſiluer, but alſo of woode and of earth, the one (I ſay) to honour, and the other to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour: whereof Saint Auguſtine hath taken his diſtinction of thoſe that are in the houſe,<note place="margin">Auguſt. lib. 7. cap. 51. de Baptiſmate, &amp; libro de vnitate ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae cap. 4.</note> and yet are not of the houſe. And this that we confeſſe in our Creede it ſelfe, that the Church is the Communion of Saints, it is not meant that all they which are there aſſembled, are ſanctified by the ſpirite of God in Chriſt, but rather that there is no true Communion, no true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:7934:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>but in the Church, calling it, as we are alwayes accuſtomed, by the beſt part. And thus much of the corruption of the perſons.</p>
               <p>Concerning the doctrine ſhe is called his ſpouſe,<note place="margin">Cant. 4.6. Iſa. 1.21. 1. Tim. 3.</note> altogether faire and without ſpotte, the faithfull Citie, the Citie of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, the temple of God, and the piller of trueth. By theſe goodly titles ſhe ſhould be ſtirred vp to pleaſe him, who vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth to call her by theſe names, and to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient vnto him. In meane time it often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times falleth out, that the Church gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by naughtie Paſtors, preſumeth to be ſuch, as her titles ſet her foorth to be, and that ſhe can neuer be any other, ſo that ſhee dareth to ſay, I am a Queene, and can be no widowe, and ſo maketh voide the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, through which alone ſhee is decked with all theſe titles. Shee neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the voice of her huſband, and maketh lawes at her own pleaſure: her gouernors will gouerne her after their guiſe, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that they are wiſe ynough of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ies. And hereupon the Prophets haue haue conſtrayned to change their ſpeach, according as ſhee changeth her gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb facs="tcp:7934:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>This is the cauſe why they haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her ſtrumpet and adultereſſe, that they haue reproched her, that ſhe hath played the harlot vnder euery buſſhie &amp; greene tree, that they call her Princes the Princes of Sodome,<note place="margin">Ier. 3.12. Ezech. 18.23.</note> and her people the people of Gomorrhe: to be ſhort, that they threaten her that God will remoue his tabernacle from thence to others.<note place="margin">2. Theſſ. 2.</note> And Saint Paul ſayeth that they ſhould be ſo deceiued, for hauing neglected the trueth of God, that they ſhal worſhip Antichriſt in the Church. The reaſon hereof is very cleare, that the Church is as the moone, a body thicke &amp; cloudie, which hath no light but from Chriſt the ſunne thereof. By meanes that ſhe looketh towards him, ſhe is bright and cleare, and the more ſhe turneth away from him, the leſſe brightneſſe ſhe hath, &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe withdraweth her ſelfe ſo farre from him, &amp; ſo great a maſſe of earth ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it ſelfe betwene them, that ſhe ſeemeth altogether eclipſed.</p>
               <p>Hereof it is, that of this vniuerſall Church diſperſed throughout the whole worlde, and gathered together into parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches of all the nations thereof,
<pb facs="tcp:7934:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>wee maye ſee ſome vtterly rooted out by the iuſt iudgement of God, as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians, Coloſſians, &amp; many others of the Eaſt, which were erected by the Apoſtles the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: others to be erected elſe where, through the euerlaſting goodneſſe of God towards mankinde: Some by the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, to be corrupted both in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and doctrine, as thoſe of Greece, of Egypt, of Affrike, &amp;c. Others by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of their leaders, hauing nothing left ſound, as the Church of Rome at this day. To be ſhort, ſome other gone from he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie to infidelitie, as in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries where Mahomet begunne his ſect, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together the fruites of the firſt ſinne of man, who of him ſelfe turned awaye from God to himſelfe, and was blinded in his owne loue, thinking to be wiſe enough to guide himſelfe without the worde of God. Thus much in few words, concerning the parts of this viſible Church, nowe vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall. But let it ſuffiſe for this time, that wee reſolue our ſelues, that this Church is the Aſſemblie or Congregation of all thoſe which make profeſſion of Chriſt, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole worlde: that vnder her are
<pb facs="tcp:7934:18"/>comprehended al the particular churches, to which the promiſes of Chriſt, made to this univerſall Churche, belong equally: That of the ſame ſome are pure, and ſome impure, according as they are turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from God to themſelues: to be ſhort, that the purer churches are impure before God, ſeeing he hath not founde puritie in his angels, ſauing that he ſupporteth them in mercie, in Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne our Lorde.</p>

               <p>THe Catholique or vniverſall viſible Church is the aſſemblie of all thoſe which make profeſſion of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Ieſus Chriſt throughout the whole worlde, diſtinguiſhed (as we haue ſayd) into many particular Churches, all which do make but one body. Of all theſe particular, as members and parts of one &amp;

Thoſe that are of the purer and ſounder Churches, we call them ſound and true Churches, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſenting to the true doctrine, which is the name, that for the moſt part, the auncient fathers haue giuen them. The others wee call the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, hereticall or ſchiſmatical Churches, according as they erre, either in faith or in charitie, agaynſt the ſquare and right rule of Chriſt, or againſt the rule of his Church, either in the one or in the other, notwithſtanding euery one in his degree. And yet for all this, both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are truely Churches, that is to ſay aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, that make profeſſion of Chriſt: but they are not pure Churches, that is to ſay, ſeruing God in Chriſt onely, in puritie and veritie: euen like as a lying perſon is truely a man, albeit he be not a true man, &amp; a man ceaſeth not to be a man, howſoeuer he be diſfigured without, and inwardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

               <p>I knowe very wel that the auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and principally the Latines, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call the pure Church Catholike, by excellencie, to diſtinguiſh it from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of heretikes: but to ſpeake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, there is no particular Church, how pure &amp; ſound ſoeuer it be, that can bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led univerſall: And if we giue them their name, becauſe they are partes of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Church, by the ſelfe ſame reaſon, it ſhould agree aſwell to the moſt impure Churches themſelues. And in deede this worde (Catholike) was not put in our Creede, for to diſtinguiſh a pure Church from an impure, but to diſtinguiſh the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh Church, in times paſt tyed to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, from the Chriſtian Church, which by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Ieſus Chriſt, was ſpread throughout the whole worlde, that is to ſaye, to authorize the vocation of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles

And if a man ſhall deepely way this thing, he ſhall finde that this maner of ſpeaking vſed of the auncient fathers, calling the ſound and true Church Catholike, came of the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they had againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Schiſmatikes, as againſt the Nouatians, Donatiſtes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who tooke vpon them to binde the whole Church to themſelues, and ſhut out all the reſt of the world beſides: as namely the Donatiſtes, who tyed it to a little cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Affrike,<note place="margin">Auguſtin. paſtin. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt.</note> vnder the colour that they preſumed that they themſelues were more holy then the reſt, againſt whom, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende to ſtoppe their mouthes, they oppoſed the Catholike or vniuerſall Church according to the Scripture, ſpredde throughout the whole world.</p>
               <p>Nowe it followeth that we ſearch out
<pb facs="tcp:7934:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>the true markes of this Church, which we call the true &amp; pure Church, or if we like better, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Catholike Church, to diſtinguiſh it from the impure &amp; erroneous Church. We haue ſaid alredy y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God, vouchſafing through his goodnes to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father of one ſort of men, would alſo that his Church ſhould be the mother, and we knowe very wel, that it belongeth not to the mother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, to bringforth children into the world, but ſhe is a true mother who alſo nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth them, and careth for them, after ſhee hath brought them forth. Nowe through Baptiſme we are auowed to be the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, and of children of wrath which we were, we are through his word cheriſhed &amp; nouriſhed vp in the faith: and ſhe at the firſt giuing vs ſucke, and afterwards more faſt and ſtrong meate, through the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt his bodye in the Supper, we are more and more vnited to him, and by this meane inueſted into that heauenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. It followeth then, that ſhe is the pure Church and true mother, who brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth: foorth vs her children through Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, regenerateth &amp; noriſheth vs through the worde, knitteth vs to Chriſt, and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amongſt
<pb facs="tcp:7934:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>our ſelues one to another, through the Sacrament of his Supper: that is to ſaye, ſhee is the true mother, in which the worde of God is purely preached, and the Sacraments according to the ſame worde duely adminiſtred. In the Church of Iuda and Iſrael, Circumciſion occupied the place of Baptiſme, &amp; the Paſſeouer of the Supper, the worde of God alwayes kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his place, as the ordinarie nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the children of God: and therefore we ſee, that after their entrie into the land of Canaan, Ioſue being admoniſhed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, to repaire thoſe faults committed in the deſert,<note place="margin">Ioſue. 1.18 &amp; 19. cap.</note> made the people to be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and bound them by an othe (if they would be his people) to keepe the word of God, that is to ſaye, if they would bee his Church. Likewiſe Ioſias, after ſo great confuſions and mingle mangles, when he would reforme the Church, in which there was not ſo much as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> viſible marke, which circumciſion had left in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh, we ſee that he began there, firſt digging vp as it were the law, which had bene buried, &amp; publiſhed the ſame, and made the people to ſweare ſolemnly vnto it.

<pb facs="tcp:7934:21"/>cauſe that he calleth the Church his wife, he teacheth her her duety, which is to obey his worde, and not to hearken to the voyce of a ſtraunger, not to loſe the tokens, nor to defile the Iewels and pledges of her mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: but marke how he ſpeaketh in expreſſe wordes, He that is of the trueth heareth my voice.

And we nothing doubt to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with them, &amp; that God is there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, howſoeuer in ſome certaine pointes of doctrine there haue bene ſome errour, and in the outward policie ſome abuſe, and corruption, and impuritie in maners: for it behooueth that alwayes we reſort thither, when the chiefe pointes of the foundation of our ſaluation be there truly taught, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are men, &amp; the Churches are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of men, as ſpeache and language conſiſt of ſyllables and letters: of the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of which men, as long as the Church is in this world, ſhe is alwayes a partaker. As concerning the falſe and impure Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, they are not ſo eaſely to be defined. Trueth, ſoundnes and right, are but of one ſort: but errors, diſeaſes, &amp; crookedneſſes are without nomber. Againe, there are many kindes &amp; degrees of impure Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: notwithſtanding, we can ſay in one worde, that al thoſe Churches are impure, in which the word of the Lord, and his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are impurely miniſtred, that is,
<pb facs="tcp:7934:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>are adminiſtred both againſt the honor of God, and the ſaluation of our neighbour: and becauſe that the whole Goſpel is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but faith and charitie, and whole Chriſt, nothing but head and body, we may make two principall kindes thereof, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thoſe Heretikes which erre in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith &amp; doctrine of Chriſt, &amp; thoſe ſchiſmatikes, which ſunder themſelues from charitie, and from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> communion of his body which is the Church, yea although they agree otherwiſe to the trueth of doctrine in all pointes.</p>
               <p>Nowe as there are many pointes, in the Chriſtian doctrine, ſo alſo there are many kindes of hereſies, ſome in one point, and ſome in another, and ſome in one point more heinous and grieuous then another, and furthermore, ſome in one point alone, and others in more points then one. No o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then in a naturall body, ſome ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is in the vitall part thereof, another in the inſtrumentall, one a ſimple heate of the liuer, another a burning in all partes of the body alike: to be ſhort, one a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in ſome one part, another diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, or euil diſpoſition of al the body.
<pb facs="tcp:7934:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>Such a Church then, as hath plaied the harlot with falſe gods, and hath beleeued the noughtie counſaile of men, may be in ſuch ſort infected with hereſie, that euen from the crowne of the head, to the ſole of the foote, a man ſhall not ſee one ſounde place. Notwithſtanding, theſe ceaſſe no more to be the Churches of Chriſt, becauſe they are heretikes, then a man that is diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ceaſſeth therefore to be a man: but in this that they are Heretikes in the doctrine of Chriſt, this ſheweth vnto vs that they are yet Churches, howſoeuer we diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the diſeaſe from the body, altogether like as we know that a ſicke man is a man, and not yet the carkaſſe of a man. But then they are not any more Churches, when they come to the hereſie of infidelitie, when Chriſt, who is the ſoule of the Church is no more accompted for a Sauiour an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Mediatour, when this mediation which ioyneth Chriſt to his Church, as the necke doeth the head to the bodye, is cut of: as for example. When the Chriſtians of Aſia in many places, of Neſtorians became Mahomites, that is to ſay, of Heretikes became Infidels (what praiſe ſoeuer the
<pb facs="tcp:7934:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>Alcoran giueth to Ieſus Chriſt) becauſe then the ſoule is out of the body, and the winde pipe is cut, and the bill of diuorce is publiſhed betwixt Chriſt and them, after they haue once openly maried themſelues to another, and haue ſought their happines and ſaluation, without him.</p>
               <p>This is to come againe to that I haue before ſpoken of, that the markes of the true Church are theſe, that of a pure and chaſte wife of Chriſt, and the mother of the heires of the father, ſhe engender children to God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe nouriſh them vp vnto him, and that ſhe vnite them vnto Chriſt: for one of theſe points alone, maketh her not worthy of this title, but all together: for ſhe is not a true mother, who engendreth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and afterwards leaueth them at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and yet ſhee is truely a mother.<note place="margin">Ezech. 16.20.</note> Now ſuch a one was the Church of Samaria, or the Church of Iſrael,<note place="margin">Ezech. 23.37.</note> in which there was remaining circumciſion and alſo the lawe, but this was in name only. She was (ſaith the Lord) an adultereſſe, and played the harlot with euery one that came, that is, there was no idolatrie which was not welcome thither: and yet a litle after, he
<pb facs="tcp:7934:25"/>ſayth ſhe engendred children vnto him. She engendred (I ſay) children to God, who accompted them his owne through circumciſion (although ſhe had deſerued by theſe adulteries to be reiected) foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuorce was not yet made with her, and they as yet were in the couenant: but hauing brought forth children to God, ſhe offreth them vp to Moloch, ſhe maketh them to paſſe through the fire, ſhe enſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them in al idolatrie, that is to ſay, ſhe giueth them to the deuill, and made them inheritours of hell, aſmuch as laye in her. Now it is ſaid in the ſelfe ſame places, that Ieruſalem, ſiſter vnto Aholibah, in which alſo God had choſen his tabernacle, had done much worſe, in ſuch ſort that ſhe was made lower the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sodom. This the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is that,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.15</note> that Ieſus Chriſt ſayth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Phariſes, Ye trauel by ſea &amp; by land to make a proſelyte, that is, to the ende you may circumciſe a Painime, and bring him into the Church, and when this is done, ye make a double childe of hell: for ye teache him as ill, that circumciſion is worſe to him then vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, becauſe that his knowledge which he hath of the true God, turneth to
<pb facs="tcp:7934:26"/>his condemnation. That the like ſhoulde come to paſſe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of Chriſt, there is no doubt at all: for in the beginning there haue bene hereſies in the chiefe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our faith, that is, diſeaſes in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and vital partes of the body, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the doctrine of the God head and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Ieſus Chriſt. The ſinne of man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued death: It muſt needes be then, that the mediatour was very God and very man, Man, for to die the death, and God, to ouercome death. And therefore they which denie the diuinitie of Chriſt, they deny the principall qualitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mediatour, through which we obtaine ſaluation. Now the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is made nothing, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eternitie is made void. For where we finde the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, there naturally we neede not doubt of an end. This hereſie and many ſuch like were ſcattered throughout many notable Churches: Notwithſtanding, foraſmuch as the auncient Church hath iudged that their baptiſme ought not therfore to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, ſhe hath ſhewed by conſequence, that ſhee hath holden them for Churches, for all their deadly diſeaſes, foraſmuch as Chriſt, from whom true Baptiſme and the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie
<pb facs="tcp:7934:26"/>thereof is, baptizeth not but in the Church, ſhewing thereby, that there may be found Chriſtian Churches which bring forth their children as mothers, and yet nourriſh and inſtruct their children worſe then ſtepmothers. And therfore they adde, that this Baptiſme which profited them in their infancie, falleth out to their further hurt, when they come to yeres of diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when they come to taſte on theſe hereſies, whereof they had no ſenſe or feeling.</p>
               <p>The Latine Church, as Ieruſalem to Samaria, ſet it ſelfe then very couragiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt ſuch errors, and healed many of them, whereupon it got great aucthoritie amongſt all: but afterwards, a worſe euill came vnto it, and that was this, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing through Gods goodneſſe, (who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies preſerueth his trueth in ſome place) bene exempted from the foreſaide hereſie and ſickenes, ſhe was borne in hand that it came of her owne ſtrength, and that ſhee could not any more be deceyued, as he, who for hauing his health one yeere, giueth him ſelfe to all diſorder, thinking that it can no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hurt him, whereupon we ſay, that ſhe is fallen into a generall diſtemperance, and
<pb facs="tcp:7934:27"/>is ſo laden with hereſies, that ſhe is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throughly ſicke, but ſhe is as it were ſickneſſe it ſelfe, not feeling her euill at all. We ſay then of her, the ſame that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Ezechiel ſaid of Ieruſalem, who was the onely ſeate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde: Samaria hath not offended to the one halfe of thy ſinnes:<note place="margin">Ezech. 15.48.</note> Sodom thy ſiſter hath not done, neither ſhe nor her daughters, as thou haſt done and thy daughters. Thou haſt iuſtified thy ſiſters, in all the abominations which thou haſt done, and therefore I wil bring againe thy captiuitie, and thou ſhalt beare thy vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany. The worde of God is the only meate which God hath giuen for the ordinarie nouriſhment of his children. The Latine Church, to the end ſhe might nouriſh them with huſkes and ſhales, hath hidden it from them, &amp; buried it in the earth, or if for ſhame ſhe hau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

In ſtead that this worde ſhoulde haue directed vs to God for our ſaluation, ſhee hath ſent vs to men, which are nothing but perdition, yea to the ſonne of perdition him ſelf. Whereas ſhe ſhould haue aſſured vs in the infinite merites of one Chriſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> infinite
<pb facs="tcp:7934:27"/>God, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papacie hath turned vs to our own merits, which merite nothing but hell and death. The whole law was giuen to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, but to make vs feele our ſinnes, &amp; to ſearch the remedie thereof in the grace of Chriſt: but contrariwiſe the Romane Church maketh vs to play y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes, more then the Iewes, promiſing vs ſaluation of our ſelues, to the ende that making vs to ſearch for it that wayes more feruently, ſhee might therein ſhewe vs hell. She hath receyued the deuill into the Lordes houſe, ſhe hath mingled in his bread of life, death, and into his cuppe ſhe hath put poyſon: to conclude, if through Baptiſme, which ſhe hath notwithſtanding many wayes profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſhe enrouleth children to God as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet is it certaine on the contrary part, that through her falſe worſhips, ſhe nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth them vp to the deuil. And as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſaluation in Ieſus Chriſt, which is the necke that ioyneth the head with the body, Ieſus Chriſt with his Church, it is ſo cut of by mans merits, by the merits of Saintes, by the Popes pardons, and ſuch other wickedneſſes, that the life of the Church holdeth but by a very litle thread,
<pb facs="tcp:7934:28"/>the which had bene ſtraightway quite cut off (Antichriſt had ſo wel laboured therein) had not God through his great mercy ſent his ſeruants in time to repreſſe him. As long then as this threade remained there, we deny it not the name of the Church, no more then vnto a man, the name of a man, as long as he liueth, what ſickeneſſe ſoeuer he haue: yea, we are content to call her the ſpouſe, ſo that therewithall ſhee ſuffer vs in like maner to call her an adultereſſe. But we ſay that ſhe is an heretical Church worſe then al the Churches that euer haue bene, a wife which prouoketh God to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce, a mother which nouriſheth vp her children to the diuell, and we pray God, that he will vouchſafe to take her in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, being defiled in her blood,<note place="margin">Ezech. 16.</note> and that he will waſhe her in her olde age in the blood of his ſonne, &amp; that he will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as he promiſeth to Ieruſalem &amp; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, the couenant made with her from her youth, and that as he hath done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readye in a good parte of her members, it woulde pleaſe him to reſtore her againe to her firſt puritie and integritie. See then as concerning the hereticall and impure
<pb facs="tcp:7934:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>Churches in doctrine, whereof we mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Romane and Latine Church to be in the chiefeſt degree.</p>
               <p>Concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Schiſmatical Churches, whether they are plainely ſchiſmatical, or whether hereſie foloweth after a ſchiſme, as a feuer doth after a wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, heretikes &amp; ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes in this ſenſe are all one. Of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes we haue ſpoken as before. Of Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes we make here two diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The cauſe (ſayth the Canon) maketh a ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, &amp; not the ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; therfore we ſay, that they which haue giuen others a iuſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſeparate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues from their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſchiſmatikes, &amp; not they who haue taken it. For this cauſe, the Apoſtles were not ſchiſmatikes, although they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated them ſelues from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scribes &amp; Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes, &amp; cut themſelues of from their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: But rather the Prieſtes &amp; Scribes, which put them to death, when they ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them ſelues to verifie the comming of Chriſt amidſt the Church: &amp; we ſhall proue in his proper place, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſelfe ſame in like maner is come to paſſe in our time, of thoſe which haue verified Antichriſt in an open councill. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond, we ſay, that we muſt
<pb facs="tcp:7934:29"/>diſtinguiſh betwixt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> author of a ſchiſme, &amp; thoſe which followe it. That the authors of Schiſme, foraſmuch as they rent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from charitie, &amp; ſo by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence from the body of Chriſt, they may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, Core, &amp; Abiram, cutting themſelues (aſmuch as in them lyeth) out of the booke of life. Concerning the others, we ſay that they are the flocke of Chriſt, but euil gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their paſtors, and principally thoſe which are borne vnder the Schiſme, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as neither of both are without blame, neither can in any wiſe excuſe themſelues. And therefore Dathan and his companions were ſwallowed vp,<note place="margin">Nomb. 16.</note> and the congregation which cleaued vnto him was ſpared: but in that it ſawe the horrible puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of thoſe whom it had followed, it was warned to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate it ſelfe for feare of the like. In like maner Ieroboam &amp; his ſucceſſors, which through ambition had made a ſchiſme in the Church, were accurſed, and yet Samaria ceaſed not therefore at the leaſt to be in the couenant of God, neither by reaſon of her falſe worſhips, halfe Iewiſh &amp; halfe heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. To be ſhort, ambition &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> want of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie wherof it proceedeth, theſe make ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes,
<pb facs="tcp:7934:29"/>&amp; therefore the poore people which do not holde thereof, but are caried away w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the faction of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mightieſt, as it were with a ſtreame, this although it be a ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet properly it is not a ſchiſme. And euen as in factions which are made in a kingdome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common wealth, a good prince pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth the Captaines, &amp; through his cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie pardoneth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, who were let alone either to go through ignorance, or in reſpect of their authoritie &amp;c. euen ſo it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the father of mercy doeth towards his poore children, which for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt part do mourne vnder the ambition of the prelates, &amp; are not partakers of their ſubtill cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels. This be ſimply ſpoken of the Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Churches, that is to ſay, which haue no notable hereſies ioined with their ſchiſmes. The like thing alſo may be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the heretikes: for oftentimes the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church are heretikes by their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties in certaine things, &amp; not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people who vnderſtand the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, contenting themſelues with the ſimplicitie of the worde which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes is moſt true. But we will ſpeake of this more amplie in another place.</p>
               <p>We wil conclude then that the workes of
<pb facs="tcp:7934:30"/>the pure Church are fayth and charitie, the worde and the Sacramentes purely &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully adminiſtred.<note place="margin">Auguſt. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Fauſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, lib. 19. ca. 11.</note> The markes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> impure Churches are, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therin they faile in part, or be impure: the which thing many times falleth out ordinarily together.

<pb facs="tcp:7934:31"/>ſpeake in man. But foraſmuch as they make an inſtance ſo lowe, it behooueth that we giue them a more full anſwere. The queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is here of the puritie of the Church. Nowe the Church is compared to a litle barke or ſhip, and the more ſhe is vpon the Sea, the more ſhe leaketh: and vnto a houſe, which with age decayeth, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to ruine: and to a Citie, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie of it corrupted, if once a man drawe it to any other beginning: and to a mans body, to which yeeres doe bring an heape of al kinde of euils. To be ſhort, to the moſt healthful and temporate body in the world, age is euen as ſickenes it ſelfe. I ſaye then that antiquitie alone, ought to make vs thinke that in the Church there is a great ſickeneſſe and much filthynes, and that euen for this cauſe alone without any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger confutation, it behooueth vs to bring a broome to purge it, and to call for a Phyſition: ſo farre is it of, that for theſe things a man ſhould mayntayne that ſhe is pure and ſound, as they do. Furthermore I demaund howe they will aunſwere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heathen, yea to Saynt Auſtine him ſelfe,<note place="margin">Auguſt. ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Pſal. 64.</note> who ſayeth that Ieruſalem began
<pb facs="tcp:7934:31"/>by Abel, and Babylon by Rain. Alſo that the promiſe was by Iſaac, and the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardiſe by Iſmael which was the elder. Conſequently what would they haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered vnto the Iewes in the time of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſte, if that antiquitie had beene a true marke of the Church? They ſayde that they were the children of Abraham. Nowe he was called the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the beleeuers. For they had their genealogie from the creation of the firſt man. They could haue alledged the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantes that were made of olde betweene God and them. And after that Chriſte was ſent vnto them according to theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, vnder the ſhadowe of this antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they called him the Carpenters ſonne, a Samaritan, one that hath the deuill, a Preacher of noueltie: and there is great likelyhood, that if our maſters had beene then there in that time (ſeeing that they keepe the ſelfe ſame argumentes) they would haue holpen to haue crucified him. Nowe we ſay likewiſe that Antichriſt who was foretolde vnto vs, entered into this ruinous houſe, whiles the moſt part was a ſleepe in this dead ſleepe of antiquitie, in
<pb facs="tcp:7934:32"/>ſteade of that was ſaid vnto them, Watch &amp; pray: &amp; that the ſubtilleſt lent him their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d till he had turned all topſituruie, and yet men would not know him. Furthermore I demaund what they wil aunſwere vnto the Greeke Churches, the Armenians, Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians &amp;c. founded by the Apoſtles, &amp; as olde as the Church of Rome, yea and elder too, ſeeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Church of Chriſt, as we know, tooke her beginning from the Eaſt to the Weſt? If antiquitie be a marke of puritie, they are pure: &amp; if they be pure, the Latine Church in compariſon &amp; to their iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, is moſt impure. If they be heretikes &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, as the Latine Church doth hold them, then it followeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> antiquitie is not a marke to proue the puritie or veritie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church. Howe then? ſhal we reiect antiquitie? nay rather we embrace it with all our heartes, &amp; a great deale better then our aduerſaries: but in ſuch fort we embrace it, as the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteſt of tymes be aſked,<note place="margin">Dan. 8.</note> &amp; heard before al our fathers, and alwaies according to this moſt certaine rule, that <hi>Primum quodque veriſſimu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt things are trueſt, that is to ſay, that when there ſhalbe any queſtion of a pure Church, we looke into the word of
<pb facs="tcp:7934:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>God what ſhe hath bene of olde time, &amp; that we draw her from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ruſt of our euils which ſhe hath gotten through age, &amp; ſo reſtore her vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beauty &amp; integritie of her youth. See then how we ought to honour antiquitie, to reforme our ſelues according vnto it, and not to ſuffer our ſelues to be corrupted w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ruſt, and ſo to periſh vnder the ſhadow of it. This is the rule which our maſter hath giuen vs. When there was queſtion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning diuorce, that Moſes had agreed vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people for the hardnes of their heartes, they had a preſcription long inough, if preſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might haue had place againſt the inſtitution of God: Notwithſtanding he anſwereth in one woorde, <hi>It was not ſo from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 10.4.</note> that is to ſay, there was no ſuch ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of god. Tertullian ſaith, Preſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is nothing againſt the trueth, neither time,<note place="margin">Yert. de vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginibus ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landis.</note> nor authority of perſons, nor priuiledges of kingdomes. For there is no fooliſh cuſtome which can haue authority againſt the trueth. Now Chriſt is called the trueth, and not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome. And if Chriſt be alwaies, &amp; more au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then al, then alſo is trueth more aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent then al cuſtomes. Hereſies haue alwaies bin va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth, &amp; not by noueltie,

In the end we are aduertiſed that when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſonne of man

Moreouer, the Chriſtians which reiect the Pope in Aſia, and in Affrica, are a great many moe in number then the others.

For the Church is not any longer tyed to Ieruſalem, but we ſee euery day that God calleth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, euen thoſe which ſeemed not to be his people, and contrarywiſe he hath permitted by his righteous will, that many Chriſtian Churches haue bene turned into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Turkes,<note place="margin">Apo. 12.6. &amp;c.</note> as that of Epheſus fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Moreouer the Church is a citie, that is to ſay, one vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Citizens vnder the iuſt gouernement of Chriſt. Now betweene a citie and a towne there is this difference, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in walles, &amp; the other in the vnion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple gouerned vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame lawes, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie of Rome was at Veies w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus being a baniſhed man,<note place="margin">

And Themiſtocles ſaide that Athens was in ſhippes which the Romanes had taught the poore Carthagians to their coſt, when they made their Citie to be caried out of their towne. To be ſhort, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues haue maintayned for lxxx. yeeres together, that the Romiſh Church had her ſea in Auignio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> although they had forſaken Rome.

<pb facs="tcp:7934:36"/>many poynts of doctrine. To conclude, if euer there were Church that might alledge ſucceſſion of place, it was Ieruſalem. For of it was ſaid, The Lord wil euermore dwel in this Temple:<note place="margin">2. Chro. 33 Pſal. 33. 2.

But ſee what the Lorde him ſelfe anſwereth vnto them: Goe ſaith he, &amp; ſee Shiloh, I haue choſen it from the beginning, for my houſe. Now ſee what I haue done vnto it for the wickednes of my people, I wil do euen ſo to the place, which I haue giuen vnto you and to your fathers. But if you will that I dwell there, amende your wayes, &amp; turne from your euil deedes. Nowe if he haue forſaken his owne temple for the iniquitie of the prieſts, beſides which he had none erected in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world, muſt we tye our ſelues to the Church of Rome, or to any other place, ſeeing that al the Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of the world are equally his temple?</p>

Moreouer to them it was promiſed, that they ſhoulde ſo continue for euer. And hereof it was, that when the Prophets exhorted them to reformation, they had no other thing in their mouth, The lawe ſhall not periſh from the Prieſt, nor the councell from the wiſe, nor the worde from the Prophete. But the ſpirite of the Lorde aunſwered them,<note place="margin">Ierem. 8.8.</note> Say not, We are wiſe, &amp; the lawe of the Lord is with vs. For it is in vaine, that the pen is made, and that there is a ſcribe.

               <p>Concerning miracles, if a man ſpeake of thoſe which were wrought either in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the lawe by Moſes,<note place="margin">Miracles.</note> or in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Goſpel by Ieſus Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, it is certaine that they were generally wrought, aſwel for the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans as for the Iewes, for heretikes as for ſincere &amp; ſound profeſſours, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pure chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as for the impure, foraſmuch as the onely queſtion is towards one to ſhewe the true God giuing forth the lawe, &amp; towards the others, the true Chriſt promiſed in the lawe, whom both the one &amp; the other make profeſſion to receiue &amp; worſhip. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is common to both two. Concerning the other which they alledge, ſpecially in that ſame ſtate in which we ſay Antichriſt heareth dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I ſay they are falſe in effect,<note place="margin">Titus Liuius in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> becauſe they heare witneſſe to falſhood: but if they had any true, yet they are not therefore ſure teſtimonies of the trueth. The heathen had their deuiliſh mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in the temples of their falſe gods, &amp; ſome in effect true, as may appeare by all
<pb facs="tcp:7934:39"/>their hiſtories. Simon Magus, who would be ack nowledged for Chriſt, wrought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. So likewiſe did Apollonius Tia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus and Apuleus of Madaure. But theſe for the moſt part might be illuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil wrought to abuſe fooles, hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (as S. Auguſtine ſaith) more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this,<note place="margin">Auguſtine de vtilitate credend. cap. 16. 2. Kin. 18.24.</note> then their outward ſenſes. But God wrought thoſe great miracles among the Samaritanes, in their ſtrongeſt Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, as when he made the Aſſyrians to be eaten of Lyons, for to reuenge his conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt among his enemies, &amp; not to authorize the faultes &amp; abuſes of the people. He wrought ſome in the time of thoſe hereſies next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt, to ſhewe the power of his name to al nations. Yea it ſhould not ſeeme ſtraunge, when he will worke ſuch in lands newly found, for to va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſh the deuils which reigned there. Al this then is too litle to be a marke of the pure Church, vnleſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churches of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Samaritans, &amp; the heretikes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former times had bene pure churches. This is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which S. Auguſtine anſwered to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Donatiſts,<note place="margin">Auguſt. lib. de vnitate Eccleſiae. cap. 46.</note> which would proue their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine by miracles. You alledge (ſayth he) miracles, in which a man is not to be heard
<pb facs="tcp:7934:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>in reſpect of the place, but in regard of his deſire. We wil not proue our church, neither by ſucceſſion of Biſhops, neither by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of councels, nor by the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, nor by viſions nor dreames. All ſuch things are to be allowed ſo farre foorth as they are done in the Catholike Church, but they proue not that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church is Catholike, for that dependeth vpon the ſcriptures. Our Sauiour Chriſt hideth not this from vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wil caſt into euerlaſting fire thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue wrought miracles in his name.<note place="margin">Mat. 7.</note> This is not then as our aduerſaries ſay, a gift that ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth them that do them. It is alſo foretold vs that many falſe Chriſtes ſhall come with miracles,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.</note> to ſeduce if it were poſſible, euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> elect.<note place="margin">2. Theſſ. 2.</note> And S. Paul ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Antichriſt ſhal come according to the efficacie of Sathan, in all power, &amp; ſignes &amp; miracles of deceit. This then is as litle,<note place="margin">Hierom. vpon the 7. of Mat. Chriſoſt. vpon the 1. Epiſt. 2. Theſſ. Auguſt. lib. 20. cap. 19. De ciuitate Dei.</note> a gift of the ſpirit ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying and purifying the Church. This is more: for ſome of theſe miracles ſhal not be altogether falſe in effect, but onely in their end, that is, becauſe they tend to a falſe end, to eſtabliſh the ſeate of Antichriſt, as ſaint Auguſtine hath taught vs vpon this place: and Saynt Iohn Chryſoſtome, when hee
<pb facs="tcp:7934:40"/>ſaith, that there are miracles not onely of il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion,<note place="margin">Auguſt. ſuper. pſal. 9.</note> but true and effectuall, tending to bring in falſhood. Now if miracles approue the puritie of the Church, and the trueth of doctrine, then Antichriſt hath gained his cauſe, if not, it is ſo farre of that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miracles wrought vnder the Papall ſea, ought to be alledged for confirmation of puritie, that rather quite contrary, ſeeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are promiſed before the comming of Chriſt but his owne, we ſhould ſuſpect, that the Romane Sea is that prodigious ſea of Antichriſt, which was before foretolde vs. Let vs folow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amiddeſt theſe difficulties,<note place="margin">Luk. 24.</note> the inſtruction that Ieſus Chriſt hath giuen to all Chriſtians in the perſon of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. There were miracles wrought before his birth, but none were nere acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panying his owne birth, &amp; therfore there could be no abuſe in it. In his life time there were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit ſort wrought, of which they were made eye witneſſes: he being faſtened to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe, dead, &amp; buried, &amp; afterwardes they ſawe him eate and drinke with them. But of al thoſe famous Magicia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, their inchantments died with them, neither was there euer one ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp againe. For it was inough for him to
<pb facs="tcp:7934:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſay vnto them at his departure, You haue ſeene the ſingular miracles which I haue wrought. You ought therefore no more to doubt, that I am that ſame anoynted, which was promiſed vnto you. Contrariwiſe, he ſendeth them to the Prophetes, to Moſes, to the Pſalmes, and to be ſhort, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Scriptures, to the ende they may there marke what they haue ſeene, and what was therefore told them by the Spirite of God, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what he had foretold them, was now alſo accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>Touching reuelations and viſions which are a kinde of miracles,<note place="margin">Reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> we haue the plaine text which decideth this matter.<note place="margin">Deut. 13.</note> If there ſhall ariſe (ſaith the Lorde) amiddeſt thee, a falſe propher, or a dreamer of dreames, and that the ſigne or miracle which he hath told thee come to paſſe, ſaying, Let vs followe ſtraunge gods, &amp;c. hearken not to the words of this Prophet &amp;c. There are then both Prophets, and viſions, true in effect, and yet falſe in theyr ende and triall: which triall is doctrine, as is to be ſeene in this place. Lykewyſe when Saint Iohn, to the ende to keepe vs from falſe prophetes, exhorteth vs to proue the Spirites, by and by he
<pb facs="tcp:7934:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>addeth,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 4.</note> Hereby ſhall you knowe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God: Euery Spirite that confeſſeth that Ieſus Chriſt is come in the fleſhe, is of God &amp;c. that is to ſay, proue the ſpirites by the doctrine which they preach. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saul &amp; Cayphas haue prophecied, but as S. Auguſtine ſaith,<note place="margin">Auguſt. lib. 2 ad Simplic. quae. 1.</note> as Balaa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Aſſe once ſpoke, and yet for all that, they myght haue once ſpoken the trueth. For the deuil him ſelfe to couller his lying, ſome times ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth trueth.</p>
               <p>We conclude then that all the foreſaide markes are not the infallible markes of the ſounde and pure Church. Firſt, becauſe they be not ſubſtantial but outwarde. Secondly, becauſe they are common, aſwell to falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood as to trueth. But that they may be markes, they ought to put a difference. Thirdly, they neede to be proued and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by another marke, to witte, doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: to be ſhort, ſeeing it is ſaid, that in the ende Antichriſt ſhall come, and ſeduce the greateſt part of the people, and that he ſhall ſitte in the Temple of GOD, that is to ſaye, in the Churche it ſelfe, and in one of the moſt famous places, and that be ſhall worke ſtrange ſignes and wonders:
<pb facs="tcp:7934:42"/>we conclude on the contrary part that anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, multitude, ſucceſſion, and miracles, are rather at this day the markes of the ſeat of Antichriſt, &amp; of that whore, then of Chriſt and of his chaſte ſpouſe, of whome Chriſt hath giuen vs this one marke, He that is of the trueth, heareth my voyce. He that is my Diſciple, abideth in my word.</p>

For both the true Chriſtians and heretikes, may haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, multitude, ſucceſſion, and miracles, as we haue already proued: but there is none

Likewiſe we ſee commonly that they which pleade together, pretende euery one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ryght is on their ſide. In meane time who wil ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſeeing both twaine ſaye they haue right, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is no queſtion to diſpute of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right but only y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he which is in poſſeſſion ſhould keepe it.

<pb facs="tcp:7934:43"/>they might ſeeke mercie in Chriſte, they haue founde out other meanes for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.

And if they ſpeake not according to this worde, the morning light ſhall not be giuen vnto them. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they obſerued not this ſacrifice, it was turned to them into a curſe, &amp; God was readie to make a diuorce with his people, &amp; therefore to cutte of at one blowe all their madneſſes,<note place="margin">Mal. 2. &amp;. 4 Oſc. 2.</note> Malachi recommendeth to the Church, the obſeruation of the law, and the ordinances giuen from Moſes, vntill the comming of Elias, that is, of Iohn the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of Ieſus Chriſt.

To be ſhort, he,
<pb facs="tcp:7934:44"/>of whom it is only ſaid, Heare him, to teach vs by his example, hath giuen ſo great authority to the lawe, that he will haue the people thereby to iudge whether he be Chriſt or no:<note place="margin">Mat. 17.</note> Search (ſaith he) dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the Scriptures: for you thinke that by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſhal haue euerlaſting life, and they are they, which beare witnes of me.

And why ſo? becauſe it is not the word of Moſes nor of Eſai, nor of any men, but euen his, who ſent him.</p>
               <p>Nowe by the comming of our Sauiour Chriſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcriptures haue loſt nothing, but rather haue the greater authority,<note place="margin">Hebr. 2.</note> God which hath ſpoken to our fathers (ſayth the Apoſtle) ſundry times &amp; in diuers maners, hath in theſe laſt times ſpoken vnto vs, by his owne ſonne.

<pb facs="tcp:7934:44"/>For it is the infinite wiſedome of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite father, and can teach vs whatſoeuer is neceſſarie for our ſaluation. And ſeeyng he hath ſo loued vs, that he came into the world to dye for vs, he would not then hide from vs the worde of life. To be ſhort, he came to lighten vs in darkeneſſe, and hath promiſed neuer to forſake vs. He hath then left vs ſome light to guide vs, and ſeeing he is that ſame light it ſelfe, it is ſuch a light, as we following it, we cannot be deceiued. Nowe this then is that ſame written word of God, which is the true image of that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall worde, in which he hath imprinted all that is neceſſarie for vs to the glorie of God, and all that is expedient for our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. The Apoſtles receyued this worde from his mouth, to preache the ſame to all the worlde, and herein they were true and faithfull Ambaſſadors. Agayne, the ſpirite of God, through which they preached, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and taught them what they ſhoulde ſay, to the ende it ſhould be deliuered vnto the poſteritie, ſo as we haue it there regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by foure ſworne Notaries of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt, and expounded in many Epiſtles of the Apoſtles. Finally, theſe Regiſters
<pb facs="tcp:7934:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the kingdome of heauen, haue gathered them together by the common care of the Churches, wherein they haue bene kept, the which haue witneſſed, that this worde proceeded from them, and thereto haue put to their ſeale: and to the ende that no Scripture myght be made equall vnto them, and to take away alſo the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all heretikes, which euery where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, and bring in, to ſerue euery turne, the traditions of the Apoſtles, the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches haue brought them into one booke, which they call the Canon, that is, the rule, and the Canonical Scriptures. See then that in the Chriſtian Church, we haue now as was vnder the lawe, one rule to iudge the right from the crooked, a ſquire to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our buylding, a compaſſe to guyde our barke, a lawe to iudge controuerſies, and a God in his woorde to determine all matters which ſhall ariſe in the Churches. All that is agreeable to this word of God, is of God, for that it is his owne word. All that is not agreeable to this worde, is of man, and no man hath any voyce in the Churche, to make any lawes concerning the ſeruice of God. The ſonne of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone,
<pb facs="tcp:7934:45"/>God and man, hath onely this power, of whom it is onely ſayd, Heare him.<note place="margin">Matth. 17.</note> Al then that is ouer and beſides this, ought to haue no place in the Church.</p>
               <p>By this worde thus limited within the bookes of the Canonicall Scripture, the primatiue Church hath taken away an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite nomber of traditions, which heretiks haue made to paſſe vnder the name of the Apoſtles, allowing nothing but that which they haue found contained in the foreſayde bookes. By the ſame alſo they haue ſtopped the mouth of hereſies, which ſprong vp of the noughtie and vnſound interpretations thereof: to be ſhort, they neuer complained, when they had any thing to doe with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, who agreed of this Iudge, accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their matter wonne, but rather when they vanquiſhed them which refuſed the ſame worde: foraſmuch as it is impoſſible to finde a Iudge, to them that refuſe to be iudged of God.</p>
               <p>Our aduerſaries alwaies cry with open mouth, The Fathers, Fathers, Fathers: but beholde whereby the Fathers woulde bee iudged, and before whome they would pleade. This controuerſie (ſayeth
<pb facs="tcp:7934:46"/>S. Auguſt.<note place="margin">Augu. epiſt. 166. &amp; lib. de vnit. Eccleſ. cap 3. &amp; 16. per totum aduerſus Donatiſtas.</note>) requireth a Iudge: let Chriſt then be Iudge himſelfe, and tel vs himſelf, wherefore he dyed. Let the Apoſtle alſo be iudge together with him: for in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle alſo Chriſt himſelfe ſpeaketh. It is ſayde, that he hath not ſpared his owne ſonne, &amp;c. but hath giuen him to the death for vs. See then the Iudge before whome he calleth the Pelagians, from whome our aduerſaries haue borowed their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. Againſt the Donatiſtes his ordinarie wordes are,<note place="margin">Auguſt. de paſtoribus cap. 4.</note> We haue founde Chriſt in the ſcriptures, there alſo muſt wee finde the Church. Alſo let it not be heard any more betwene vs, I ſay this, thou ſayeſt that, but rather ſee what the Lord ſayth, for we haue (ſaith he) the bookes of the Lord, to which we both giue conſent, we both beleeue and keepe. Againe, the canonicall Scripture is the rule of all. The epiſtles of Biſhops gyue place one to an other, and Councels are amended and corrected one by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that muſt correct all. Alſo where ſhall wee feede the ſheepe of the Lorde? Vpon the mountaynes of Iſrael: theſe mountaines of Iſrael, are the altars of the Scriptures of God. When any man
<pb facs="tcp:7934:46"/>ſhall preach according to that, from thence take taſte thereof, and all that is not from thence, caſt it awaye, for feare of ſtraying in the myſtes. And when the Donatiſtes alleadged Saint Cyprian vnto him, of whome notwithſtanding hee maketh a great accompt in all his workes, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially through whome he myght haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome them in many matters, I (ſayeth he) allowe not the wrytings of Saint Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian for canonicall. And yet herein I doe him no wrong: for not in vayne was this ſo healthfull a Canon made,<note place="margin">Auguſt. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Creſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium lib. 2. cap. 21.32.38. lib. 5. cap. 17. de baptiſm. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt.</note> in which are comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the bookes which we dare not iudge, and through which notwithſtanding wee iudge of all bookes, as well of infidelles as of Chriſtians. That which I finde there agreeable with Scripture, I accept it with prayſe, that which I finde not agreeable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by his good leaue I reiect it. And there is no doubt, ſayeth hee in another place, but that nowe he ſeeth all more cleare and bryght then when he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant in darkenes, that he will rather be glad to know how comfortable it is for vs, that in the writinges of Chriſtian orators
<pb facs="tcp:7934:47"/>and learned preachers, a man may finde things to be reproued, and that in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of thoſe poore fiſhers, that is to ſay, of the Apoſtles, a man ſhall finde no ſuch thing in them. Alledge not therefore to me, ſayeth he, in this caſe their writings, but the Lawe, the Prophets, the Pſalmes, the Goſpell, and the Apoſtle. For from hence it is, that I holde the Church is ſpread ouer all, and is not tyed vnto any certayne place.

That they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende ſufficiently the rule of faith, and whatſoeuer belongeth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeruice of God. Beholde then ſufficiently wherewithall to ſaue them. If they wil not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with ſaluation, but call the Scriptures im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, becauſe they finde not there the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of certaine curious queſtions
<pb facs="tcp:7934:50"/>which they handle in their ſchooles, and yet they doe the Scriptures wrong, for there they ſhall finde their condemnation. Moreouer I demaunde of them, from whence this imperfection can come: Is this of Chriſt: nay rather he is perfection it ſelfe. And ſeeyng he came to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhe our ſaluation, it muſt needes bee he, of whome the Church muſt wayte for the reuelation of all things. He then coulde beyng perfectly wiſe, and woulde beyng perfectly good, teache his Church whatſoeuer myght belong vnto her ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Or is this imperfection of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: but they receyued this woorde of lyfe from his mouth, and after hee ſent vnto them his holie Spirite,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.13.

The whole faulte then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not that wayes: it remayneth then that the whole imperfection bee in men, who not fynding in the Scriptures
<pb facs="tcp:7934:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>their imperfections, they eſteeme it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, as they that haue ſwilled in the ſnowe waters from the mountaynes, call thoſe imperfect, which haue not wyde and hanging throtes like themſelues, for that they haue not their ſuperfluous imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>We finde in the Scriptures the inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of one God alone, by meanes of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt alone, but they would find there the inuocation of Saints. We there finde, that purgatorie cleanſing is in the onely blood of Ieſus Chriſt, they woulde finde there that purgatorie, which they haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of Virgill and Plato. We there finde one onely Mediator: but they would finde as manie there, as there are ſaints in their kalender. They call theſe things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections in the Scripture, which are rather ſo manie infections in their Church.</p>
               <p>Furthermore I demaunde, be it that a man thinke that there wanteth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, who ſhall be ſo hardie, after ſuch a workeman, to put to his hande to make it perfect? If a man ſaye the Doctors, why then quite contrarie finde it onely
<pb facs="tcp:7934:51"/>perfect, &amp; in it as in a glaſſe they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the imperfections both of others, and of themſelues.<note place="margin">Mat. 15.9.

If the Pope doe it, he is no longer a ſcholer of Chriſt, but in this poynt he declareth himſelfe to be Antichriſt, lifting vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe aboue all that is God, and by ſuch a like gate the Alcoran of Mahomet hath entred into the worlde.

                  <note place="margin">The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is plaine and manifeſt to ſaluation.</note>Their ſeconde refufall is, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scripture is obſcure, and thereupon they call it doubtfull, a dead letter, a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which killeth, a matter of contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not the voyce of the Iudge, riddles or darke ſpeaches, and ſuch other like names whereof their bookes are full: yea one of the great Maſters of this tyme,<note place="margin">Xanctes in lib. 1. de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt.</note> could not abſtayne from ſaying, that Paul went ſo farre beyonde himſelfe, that he entangled himſelfe with many matters. But the holy Ghoſt calleth the Scripture the Teſtament &amp; couenant. And we know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a good prince, dealing with his ſubiects, wil not haue them to be circumuented and caught in words: as alſo a good father ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his laſt wil, endeuoreth to ſet his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at one, and not to ſowe diſcord, and to giue occaſion of going to law, &amp; quarels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt them. The preſumption then ought
<pb facs="tcp:7934:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>to be on the contrarie, to witte, that he which hath vouchſafed to ſaue his people ſo mercifully, and which onely may be called a true father, hath alſo deliuered his couenaunt in as cleare tearmes and expreſſe clauſes as he coulde. And in deede in all our Scriptures the Ethnikes haue not blamed any thing ſo much as to great playneneſſe of them, which is farre otherwiſe then that they woulde make men beleeue, that they are riddles or darke ſpeaches. Agayne I demaunde of them, whether the obſcuritie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doctrine be in the matter it ſelfe, or in the maner of handling it: In the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they dare not ſaye, for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more cleare and more ſimple then the doctrine of ſaluation, and this is the anſwere of Origen to Celſus, who bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the ſimplicitie of it,<note place="margin">Origen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Celſum.</note> becauſe that it muſt be ſuch as it was, becauſe it was not ſuch a philoſophie as was brought to a little nomber of men, as that of Pythagoras, of Plato, or of Ariſtotle, but a ſaluation taught and preached to the whole world, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world great &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:7934:52"/>ſmall, learned and vnlearned might eaſily comprehende. If it be in the maner of handling, ſuch obſcurity of anye authour muſt ariſe eyther of ignoraunce or of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. Of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, becauſe that, that which a man vnderſtandeth but darkely, a man can not teache plainely. Of malice, when wee will boaſte our cunning, and not teach it, as Ariſtotle ſayeth that hee did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely, in thoſe ſame bookes of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall philoſophie, which yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the worlde boaſt to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and as alſo certeyne other authours of profounde Sciences in our tyme, haue done, of ſet purpoſe. Nowe of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance there can bee none, in that wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which hath ſpoken to the Apoſtles, nor in that ſpirite which hath inſpired them. Of enuious malice, there can be as litle in him which dyed to accompliſh our ſaluation, and in them which haue publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the ſame, euen vnto their ſuffering af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him. It remaineth then, for to auoide theſe blaſphemies, that either ignorance, or much rather malice bee in our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and not in him which is wiſdome, and goodnes it ſelfe.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7934:53"/>
               <p>Againe I demaunde, whether in their iudgement is more obſcure, the Goſpel or the Prophets: They will not ſaye, I am ſure, that it is the Goſpell, for then litle children would laugh them to ſcorne. And moreouer Saint Peter ſayeth,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.19</note> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were as ſhining candles in a darke place, in ſteade whereof Chriſt is the true Sunne,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.9.</note> and that light that lighteneth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye man that commeth into the worlde. Moreouer both in the one and the other we finde Chriſt, in the one promiſed, in the other giuen, in the one to come, in the other come, in the one foretolde, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeaking him ſelfe of him ſelfe. It is therefore ſure, that the doctrine of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in Ieſus Chriſt, is leſſe darke in the Goſpell then in the Prophets, in the Newe Teſtament, then in the Olde, which is expounded and declared by the Newe.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> Nowe Dauid ſayeth that this woorde is vnto him as a lanterne for hys feete, and not onely a lanterne, but which ſerueth to leade him in the path, yea in the path it ſelfe which can not leade aſtray. That by the ſame hee is more wiſe then they that are elder. Contrariwiſe Eſaye
<pb facs="tcp:7934:53"/>pronounceth, that the watchemen of the houſe of GOD,<note place="margin">Iſa. 56.10.11.</note> who thought them ſelues verye cleare ſighted, were blinde, becauſe they had no regarde thereto. Moreouer Chriſt ſendeth not his hearers to the gloſes of the Rabbins, to traditions,<note place="margin">Iohn. 5.39.</note> to the Thalmud, to the Lawe not written, wherewith the Phariſes were puffed vp: but to the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Luke. 24.</note> to the Lawe written, and hee neuer alledgeth Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes from anye other place. Saynt Luke alſo prayſeth thoſe of Beroa, which ſearched them,<note place="margin">Actes. 17.</note> and they which ſearched them, found there their ſaluation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they which gaue them ſelues egar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſpeculations of men, crucified him. It followeth then that by a more ſtrong reaſon, wee ought at this daye, to ſearche our ſaluation in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, hauing the Olde and Newe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament together, the ſhadowe and the body, the ſtarres and the ſunne, the meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſaluation, and ſaluation it ſelfe. If anye man yet finde obſcuritie in the doctrine of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I leaue it to be iudged of all, which of the two is more plaine, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of him which
<pb facs="tcp:7934:54"/>is the light of light,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1 &amp; 8. &amp; 12.</note> or in the blindeneſſe of thoſe, whoſe ſpirits naturally are nothing elſe but darkeneſſe.</p>
               <p>But putting the caſe there were ſuch great obſcurite as they ſay, let vs ſee a litle by whome they would make it brighter. Shall it be by the doctors? Nay rather contrariwiſe, as we ſhall ſee hereafter, they reioyce not but in the brightneſſe of this ſunne. What the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſhal it be by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church: But the Church is the moone, a body ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed and darke of it ſelfe, which hath no light, but that which it giueth her. What then: ſhall it be Thomas: ſhall it be Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus: ſhall it be Bricot and a rablement of ſuch like? I report me to al men of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether they darken, or make more bright the woorde of God. It remaineth then that we ſearch in this light, the light of all our thoughtes, and that wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that if wee ſee nothing, the faulte thereof is in our eyes, and not in the light.</p>
               <p>They alledge that the Scripture is doubtefull, becauſe that Satan alledged it vnto Ieſus Chriſt. I aunſwere, that there is no lawe that a man may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
<pb facs="tcp:7934:54"/>by this argument: for all lawes are ſubiect to be alledged both by good &amp; bad. But let them alſo marke, that by the ſame Ieſus Chriſt ſtopped his mouth. Alſo, your Sauiour Chriſt hath ſpoken in parables and ſimilitudes: we know that ſimilitudes are to make cleare, and not to darken: and I make their owne conſciences iudges, whether thoſe parables of Chriſt, ſo expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as we haue them in the ſcriptures, tend to any other end. When he would teach vs who is our neighbour, he maketh it playne by the ſimilitude of the man deſcending from Iericho: what the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is, by the ſimilitude of the ſower:<note place="margin">Luke. 10. Luke. 8. Mat. 13. Luke. 15.</note> what the vocation of the Gentiles is, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall childe, and ſo likewiſe of other. I aſke if by theſe parables we may iudge more clearely or more darkely, &amp; whether all the gloſes or long co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries of the Phariſes, were able ſo clearly to expound this matter: But they will ſay, you cannot deny, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> there are manye darke places: for S. Peter himſelf ſaith,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.16.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there are ſuch in the epiſtles of S. Paul: nay but rather we may ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> foraſmuch as there are only certaine places darke, it followeth contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe
<pb facs="tcp:7934:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>that the Scripture is not darke. For this is an euill argument, to reaſon from ſome to all, and hee that ſayeth that vpon a garment there are blacke ſpottes, he ſayeth by conſequence that that gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not all blacke. And as concerning thoſe, we ſay that the light of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is ſufficient for to giue them ſuch light, as they neede not dwell anye more in darkeneſſe: vnleſſe it be thoſe whome the God of this worlde hath blinded in their vnderſtanding, as Saynt Paul ſayth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.</note> to the end they ſhould periſh, &amp; that the lyght of the Goſpell ſhoulde not ſhine vnto them,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.16</note> or as Saynt Peter ſayeth, in the ſelfe ſame place which they alledge, to the vnſtable and vnlearned, which peruert the Scriptures to their owne deſtruction. This is the ſentence of all the auncient fathers, with whome wee conclude thys poynte. There are (ſayeth Saynt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine) handling this matter,<note place="margin">Auguſt. libr. 2. de doctr. Chriſt. cap. 2, &amp; libr. 2. cap. 9.</note> certaine harde places in the Scripture, and yet notwithſtanding there is no other thing, but that which is expounded in moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe wordes in other places, whereby the holy Ghoſte hath wonderfully meaſured,
<pb facs="tcp:7934:55"/>and tempered the holy Scriptures, to the ende that thoſe cleare places ſhoulde ſerue healthfully to ſatiſfie the hunger of the readers, and thoſe darker places ſhoulde encreaſe their appetite, to take away all contempt: but in that that is ſpoken clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Scriptures, they ſhall finde all things which conteyne fayth and the waye to liue well, to witte, hope and charitye. And hee that will haue more examples hereof, in the foreſayde places he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth more.

The moſt obſcure and darke then that is therin, may be made plain by it ſelfe. S.

<pb facs="tcp:7934:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>thoſe thinges, which hee had ſpoken vnto them: and of thoſe thinges which hee hath ſpoken to vs in one place, let vs learne to vnderſtand thoſe things which he hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in another.<note place="margin">Marſilius de Padua, in. lib. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſ. pacis parte 1. cap 9.</note> This is that which Marſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius of Padua diſputed againſt the Pope <hi>300.</hi> yeeres agoe: that the Lawe of the Goſpell is ſufficient, perfect and plaine of it ſelfe, immediatly to direct vs to euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſaluation, and to turne vs away from the path of miſerie. But to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which finde nothing in the light but darknes, I feare that it is to no purpoſe to alledge plaine places out of the auncient doctors. The miſchief is, that we finde not in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in any place, neither the Maſſe, nor Purgatory, neither the papacie, nor the power of one man alone ouer the whole Church, and ſuch other inuentions of the prince of darkeneſſe: and therefore we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe Gods worde to be darke, to the ende we may fetch theſe goodly doctrines from thence by meane of ſome colde Allegorie, that whereſoeuer this light ſhineth not vnto vs in the Churche, wee ſhoulde knowe that there is nothing but darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7934:56"/>
               <p>But yet ſee a farther matter then the former: for it is ſo farre of, that they will accept the Scriptures for their iudge, that they them ſelues will bee Iudges o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Scripture. If the Churche (ſaye they) had not kept the Scriptures,<note place="margin">The church is not iudge ouer the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> and witneſſed of them, they had bene of no more authoritye then any other writing. Therefore the Churche is Iudge ouer the Scripture, and not the Scripture ouer the Churche. Firſt, I demaunde what that Churche is, which hath kept the Scriptures, whether this bee onelye the Chriſtian Churche, or the Iewiſh Churche alſo? Nowe wee knowe that the Olde Teſtament was deliuered from hand to hande vnto vs by the Iewes, and therefore the auncient doctours called them the booke keepers of the Churche. For they were ſo curious, that they would enter euerye tittle, and poynte, both the accentes and letters, and made a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of them. Therefore the Iewiſhe Churche was iudge of the Olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when Ieſus Chriſt came, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to verye euill purpoſe our Sauiour
<pb facs="tcp:7934:57"/>Chriſte ſendeth the people to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who might more ſafely haue bene ſent to the high Prieſtes and Phariſees. But theſe Iudges of the Scriptures, they iudged Chriſte to death, &amp; the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Students of the Scriptures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him for their lyfe. And at this daye, euen by this argument, the Iewes ſhoulde winne the victorye. It followeth then, whether they renounce this Sophiſtrye, or whether they will mainetayne it, that they renounce their Saluation. Conſequentlye I demaunde of them, Whether the Church of Rome aloue haue kept the Scriptures, or other Churches alſo: They can not ſaye that it was the Churche of Rome, or the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Churche alone: For the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall ſtorye wytneſſeth, that the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Churche gathered the Canon of the Regiſters, of thoſe Churches which were founded by the Apoſtles, and to which the ſame Apoſtles had written. Nowe there is but one Epiſtle written to the Romaines, and all the reſt are written to the Eaſte Churches. In like
<pb facs="tcp:7934:57"/>maner the Goſpell of Iohn was kept at Epheſits, and that of Saynt Marke at Alexandria, &amp;c. If then the Eaſte Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches had a greater parte in keeping the Scriptures, then the Romaine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by this argument as much, or more aucthoritie ouer the Scriptures then it: I aſke of the indifferenteſt amongeſt them, who ſhal iudge but the Scriptures? And if they iudge the Scriptures, who ſhall pronounce ſentence ouer them: If the Eaſte Churches ſhall, then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhe Churche hath loſte her Cauſe. If the Church of Rome, then thys ſhall hee in another reſpecte, then of keeping the Scriptures. If they ſaye it bee by their pretended prerogatiue of Saynt Peters Seate, it is meete that they prooue it by the Scriptures. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore marke Peters Sea, which doeth take vpon it to iudge the Scriptures, beyng yet ſubiecte to the Scripture it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Furthermore I praye euerye man to examine this concluſion. The Church of GOD hath kept the Scripture: The
<pb facs="tcp:7934:58"/>Church beareth witneſſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <hi>Ergo</hi> ſhee is aboue the Scripture. The edictes of a Prince are regiſtred in all his Countries. The lawes are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together and written by Clarkes. All Contractes and bargaines are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by witneſſes. And yet for all that, he that woulde ſaye, that they were aboue the Kinges, aboue the lawes &amp; contracts, hee ſhoulde make him ſelfe a laughing ſtocke. If they ſay that the Lawes of God haue no place, neyther more nor leſſe then edictes of ſome Princes, except they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the worde of God: I anſwere them, that it is not the Church of God that hath this priuiledge: for ſhee is the Spouſe of Chriſt, and hath learned to obey her huſbande without anye exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his commaundement, and muſt by and by holde her peace, aſſoone as ſhee heareth his woord. For ſhe knoweth alſo, that the wiſedome of her huſband (whoſe will is the rule of doctrine) is not like that of Princes, which it is neceſſarye to examine, whether it bee honeſt and profitable, Ciuile or vnciuile: but if they be ſo ſtiffe for the obteyning of this
<pb facs="tcp:7934:58"/>priuiledge, yet let them agree with mee herein: that this is that aſſemblie, which hath lyfted vp it ſelfe aboue all that is called GOD, which fearing to bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited by the Spirite of his mouth, woulde therefore mouſſell and ſtoppe vp hys mouth, all that it might.</p>
               <p>The place of Saynt Auguſtine which they alledge, maketh nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt that which hath bene ſayde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I woulde not (ſayeth hee) beleeue the Goſpell, vnleſſe the aucthoritye of the Church conſtrained or moued me. <hi>Ni me Eccleſiae Catholicae commoueret au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritas:</hi> where it is ſpecially to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that according to the ſtyle of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke, <hi>Commoueret</hi> is taken for <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouiſſet,</hi> that is to ſay, I had not beleeued the Goſpell, vnleſſe the conſent of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Church had moued mee thereto: hee meaneth not that the holy Ghoſt had not ſuch a ſtyle,<note place="margin">Contra epiſt funda. cap 5.</note> as myght make it ſelfe ſufficientlye knowen from other wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of men: For he him ſelfe inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs in this matter, in many places. Much leſſe meaneth hee, that the Church ſhoulde be aboue the Goſpell. For it is by
<pb facs="tcp:7934:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Goſpell that hee examineth all the Churches of his tyme: but rather that the vniuerſall conſent of the Churches, the which receiued ſuch &amp; ſuch bookes for the Goſpels of Chriſt, made that he could not doubt, but that they were ſo, and that the apoſtles, whoſe names thei did beare, were true authours of them. No otherwiſe then as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conſent of manye ages, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſuch and ſuch bookes to be Ciceroes, Hippocrates and Platoes, doe aſſure vs that they were theirs.

Like as then I
<pb facs="tcp:7934:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>beleeue that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> books of Manichee are his, becauſe men haue beleeued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they came thence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hand to hand: ſo alſo I beleeue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> booke of S. Matth. becauſe eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vntil vs the church hath ſo held. The queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this place, whether the writings of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles haue any voice to determine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the church: for as we haue already ſhewed, S. Aug. teacheth vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, in a M. pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but only whether ſuch and ſuch ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were the Apoſtles, yea or no. For the heretikes denied not, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the books of the Apoſtles had ſuch authority, as they muſt be obeyed, but they denyed that they were theirs, becauſe that if they had once allowed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they knew, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity reſt in them: And yet they prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded that they were neuer a whitte leſſe the church, then the Romane church doth. For they helde that Manichee the chiefe of their ſecte, was the holy Ghoſte him ſelfe. But this was a blaſphemie, not yet kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to the moſt damnableſt heretikes that euer were: that the holye Scripture was ſubiect to the Church, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her (as one of the Popes Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pions of our time ſaith),<note place="margin">Wolffgang. Herman.</note> it hath no more aucthority
<pb facs="tcp:7934:60"/>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Eſops fables. The Iewes haue taught the Gentiles, that the Olde Teſtament was the worde of God, and manye of the Gentiles beleeued it better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iewes. The Gentiles haue kept for the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans many good and auncient bookes, and haue taught them that ſuch and ſuch were the authours of them, and yet for all that, they haue not giuen anye credyte vnto them. The bookeſeller will teach vs that ſuch a booke is Hippocrates woorke, and yet for all that, hee ſhall not be a phyſitian as Hippocrates was. For it is one thing to beleeue the word of any ſome man, &amp; an other thing to be the authour of a booke. This is that which was ſaide long agoe by a great learned man:<note place="margin">Marſil. de Padua part. 2. cap. 19.</note> That the Church is true or vndouted, but as we ſay, by occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe ſhe beleeueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but the holye Scripture is ſimplie true, &amp; of it ſelfe. For it is the trueth it ſelf.</p>
               <p>There foloweth another argument, that the Church is before the Scripture:<note place="margin">Whether the Church be before the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> 
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> it is aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scripture. When we ſpeake of the Scripture, we vnderſtand the word of God, the which at the firſt was not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and afterward was written aſwell by
<pb facs="tcp:7934:60"/>Gods owne finger, as by the pennes of his ſeruants, inſpired by his holy ſpirite, as we haue before declared. But now I would demaund of them, from whence they fetch the beginning of the Church. If from the creation of man, and before ſinne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: immediatly after they were created, God gaue them a commaundement, that they ſhould not touche the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and euill, and we muſt not diſpute whether they had authoritie aboue this word, for why, they hauing diſobeyed it, all the world from man to beaſtes ſighes and grones for it. But will they not denie that the old and new teſtament had equall authoritie with this commaundement? If they take it after ſinne entred, God bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and conuinceth our firſt parents of their faulte: and this is the Lawe. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he promiſeth vnto them the ſeed, which ſhall bruiſe the head of the ſerpent: &amp; this is the Goſpell. Beholde them then dead in ſinne by the Lawe, and as it were newe borne by the promiſe of Chriſt to come, in whome, they hoping after this woorde, were made the beginning of the Church, &amp; without this they had bene loſt with all
<pb facs="tcp:7934:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>their poſteritie. Wherefore whether we fetche the Church from before the fall of man, ſhe hath no power aboue the word of God, but is iudged by it, and therefore the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion is falſe: Or whether we deriue it after, yet the word is before the regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, that is to ſay, before the Church, and that antecedent it ſelfe ſhalbe falſe. Moreouer this is an ill argument. It was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt in time, <hi>Ergo</hi> the firſt in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. For we haue a hundred Cities in Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce more auncient then our firſt kings, and yet notwithſtanding w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying they obey their lawes. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God of it ſelfe is giuen to commaunde, wheras the Church is placed in the world but to obey. And though it be ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the word of God be in power eternall, yet it is moſt certeine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it muſt be laſt in this action, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> before he commaund, it muſt needs be, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhould firſt create ſome men whom it might commaund. This then is nothing but plaine ſophiſtrie, which is not worthy to be heard in the Church. Moreouer I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of them whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they make this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether they meane to ſpeake of the whole Church, comprehending al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtates
<pb facs="tcp:7934:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>and particulars of the Church into one, or whether they ſpeake of particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of Rome alone: If thei vnderſtand the whole Church, as it is like they do: then they ſpeake nothing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> makes for them: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of Rome &amp; the whole Church, are things farre differing, &amp; before that Rome was, or any Wolfe there gaue ſuck, more then <hi>700.</hi> yeres the law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes was publiſhed in the Church. If they ſpeake of particular Churches, the Caſt churches wil demand y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame prerogatiue, and by the ſelf ſame argument, they wil ſet themſelues aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of Rome. For they are before them in time, as euery man knoweth. If the church of Rome alone, by the vertue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt, yet they are to bring forth the titles and right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and then they cannot bring forth one, that hath ſo much as any outward ſhewe. To be ſhort, all this is nothing els, but a manifeſt dotage: for if they looke to the beginning of the Church, they ſhall finde neither Rome, nor the Pope, neither the See of S. Peter, nor conſequently any authoritie aboue the word of God. If they looke to the beginning of Rome, they ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:7934:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>there finde the word, the law, the prophets expoſitors of long time before: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an authoritie farre aboue their church. But in this a man may ſee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore defence of their Church, when for the eſtabliſhing thereof, the word of God muſt fall downe, which is the foundation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pure Church.</p>
               <p>Now in this whole diſputation, they can not finde one onely word out of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent doctors, for there was neuer yet any he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike ſo mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrous, which durſt ſet it forth, till the Councill of Conſtance, where it was firſt ſet out by the doctors of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of Rome. There was the queſtion moued concerning the taking away of the cup of our Lord from the people, expreſly againſt the inſtitution of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sonne of God. There could not one place be found out in the Scriptures, which might fauour directly or indirectly, plainly or darkely ſo damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a ſacriledge. Iohn Hus called them to the holy Scripture, and they knewe well that that was full againſt them. Then firſt they began to aduiſe of thoſe goodly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes or grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds,<note place="margin">Nicol. Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan.

<pb facs="tcp:7934:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>hath no other authoritie, then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which the Church giueth it: that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scripture is, as they ſay, <hi>De bene eſſe,</hi> of the wel being,<note place="margin">Hoſſius Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din. in Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troco. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ.</note> but not of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eſſence or being of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church: that ſuch ſhould be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> interpretation as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth good to the Church: to be ſhort, that the word of God was more long and large then the word written, and that the Church is more worthie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it: to which ſome haue ſithens added, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church ſhould be in better caſe, if there were no Goſpell writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.

Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. ſeſſion. 5. cap. 2.</note> who alſo were authors of one other goodly canon forſooth, that ouerthroweth al chriſtianitie, That we muſt not keepe faith or promiſe with heretikes. Iohn Hus notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding preſſeth them yet ſomewhat more neerely. Though it were ſo (ſaith he) that the Church ſhould be aboue the word of God, to which you ſhal neuer haue me to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: Shew me yet that the minde of the auncient Church was euer ſo, that it euer ſo ordeyned, or ſo interpreted: Name me one onely auncient doctor, which is not wholly and plainly againſt it. That it is ſo, yea our owne canons do excommunicate
<pb facs="tcp:7934:63"/>all thoſe which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate not vnder both kinds: &amp; therefore to communicate vnder one, is not to be partaker of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Cardinal. Cuſan. Epiſt. 2. &amp; 3. ad Bohem.</note> but of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication. To this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they yet find another ſhift more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuous then the former: that albeit that of one commandement of the Goſpel, there be at this day another interpretation, then was in the auncient Church: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meaning which is receiued in the Church, muſt be accepted as the way to ſaluation, in aſmuch as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghoſt hath inſpired it to the Church: That is to ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Pope &amp; his mainteyners, according to their good pleaſure, may cry downe all the auncient interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Scripture, as coynes are, and put them into the Mint, to make theirs currant. Alſo that as the iudgement of the Church is changed in the Scripture, ſo we muſt preſume that the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God is changed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when that good man Iohn Hus could not content himſelfe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe horrible blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, their laſt argument was the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; the hang man to caſt him into the fire.

I leaue to the iudgement of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, whether the ſpirit of God, or the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Satan ruled there in thoſe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cills.</p>

               <p>NOw ſeeing then that they do doubt that the Scripture is not on their ſide, let vs beare at their hands that they refuſe it, and that they ſlander it as much as they can: let vs alſo ſee now whether they can allowe of any other Iudge beſides it.

<pb facs="tcp:7934:64"/>wil allowe al? Concerning any one alone they cannot, for in euery one of them, there may eaſely be found either one error or an other: but they haue ſo many errors to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, that to defend all, all the errors of all times &amp; ages would not ſuffice. Moreouer they would be aſhamed to denie, that their ſtyle is more obſcure then the ſtyle of the Scripture. Alſo they know in their owne conſcience, that in the moſt principal points they are on our ſide, and yet there is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of them, which they will accept in &amp; through al things, for as much as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne in Irenee the error of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chiliaſts, and the interpretation which he made of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apocalypſe concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of Rome, in Cyprian Anabaptiſine, in Tertullian the hereſie of Montanus, in S.

Will they then receiue all alike for Iudges? but then who ſhal be preſident in the contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their doctrine and interpretations? For euery one knoweth that there ſhall be found ſome euery where. If it be the holy Scripture, that is the thing which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. But if they refuſe the Scripture as partie or partiall, by a more ſtrong reaſon
<pb facs="tcp:7934:64"/>then, we will not accept them for Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which are parties againſt vs. In like maner ſhall it be with the ſchoolemen, if they take them for Iudges, although that they be the principall authors of the errors of the Church of Rome: for betweene Thomas, and Scotus, and theyr armies ſet in battel raye, and fighting one againſt an other, who ſhall be iudge? It remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth then that they chuſe eyther one of the Councils, or els all the Councils toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If they chuſe one, we knowe that in euery one lightly, there is ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled as yet but one thing, as for example: in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Councill of Nice, the matter of Arrius: in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of Epheſus, and of Chalcedon, the matter of Neſtorius, and Eutyches, and ſo likewyſe of others: but of theſe pointes, there is no contention betweene vs. If they will haue all, I demaund who ſhall be preſident in the errors which the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers confeſſe,<note place="margin">Auguſt. in the 2. booke of Baptiſme againſt the Donatiſts.</note> and in the contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they nomber, who ſhall redreſſe them? The ſeconde Councill of Epheſus approueth Eutyches, the Councill of Chalcedon condemneth him. The ſecond Councill of Nice mainteyneth the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
<pb facs="tcp:7934:65"/>of Images, but that of Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, aſſembled about the ſame time by Charles the great, pulleth them downe. The firſt Councill of Nice, according to the vſe of the primitiue Church, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth the marriage of miniſters, the Councilles of Neoceſaria, Mentz, and the ſeconde of Carthage forbiddeth it. The Councils of Conſtance, and of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſill, doe ſubiecte the Pope vnder the Church, yea they make him equall with other Biſhops: thoſe of Florence and of Trent, vpon paine of the blacke curſe, haue ſet him aboue all. To be ſhort, the Councill of Carthage excommunicateth and curſeth him to the deuill that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him ſelfe vniuerſall Biſhoppe, or chiefe Prieſt: and the Councill of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, excommunicateth all thoſe which hold not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Biſhop of Rome for ſuch a one. I demaunde then in theſe contrarieties, and a thouſand others of like conſequence, who ſhall determine the matter? ſhall it be the Church? Nowe the Church is that which hath ſaide ſometimes one thing, and ſometimes another: for they holde that the Church is repreſented by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb facs="tcp:7934:65"/>Councils, and thoſe for the moſt part are ſuch as we haue ſpoken of. Theſe are then Churches contrarying one an other, or rather one contrary to it ſelfe. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, if it be the Church, yet we deny that it ſhoulde be the Church of Rome: for it doeth not belong (ſay they) to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, to iudge of the vniuerſall, which is repreſented by generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. It remaineth then that they prooue the ſupremacie of the Church of Rome, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the vniuerſall Church of Chriſt: but if they cannot prooue it by the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, none of the other Churches will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them: for they did not beleeue Chriſt himſelfe, bearing witneſſe of himſelfe, but God whom they by the holy Scriptures knewe to haue ſent him. And ſeeing other Churches haue their Doctors, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and Traditions, aſwell as the Church of Rome: It muſt followe, that the Church of Rome muſt prooue her prowde prerogatiue &amp; title by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And if the Scriptures muſt be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Church of Rome, and her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue, the which pretendeth &amp; beareth men in hand to iudge all other Churches,
<pb facs="tcp:7934:66"/>then there can not be a more competent Iudge, then the holy Scripture, without which the Church of Rome is nothing more then others, and from whom, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhe hath, ſhe muſt, will ſhee nill ſhee, fetche her pretended preheminence and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</p>
               <p>Nowe if they obiect, that there is no more neede to iudge of our controuerſies, and that they haue bene oftentimes iudged alreadie by Councils:<note place="margin">Auguſt. cap. 3. &amp; 16. de vnitat. &amp;c.</note> Saint Auguſtine teacheth vs, that Councils may erre, and that the former Councils were amended by the latter, and therefore he preſſeth not the Arrians with Councils. Secondly, yf this point haue any place, what will they ſay then vnto vs, why they haue derogated from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt Councill of Nice, which is the firſt Decomenicall Councill, in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Miniſters, and in the ſupremacie of the Pope, who there was made equall with the other Patriarches? And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after the matter was ſo decided, would they haue it yet pleaded agayne in the Councill of Carthage? &amp;c. Why woulde they haue the Pope to be declared the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of God in earth, in the Councill of
<pb facs="tcp:7934:66"/>Trent, ſeeing that the Councill of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage had already pronounced him excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, which would call himſelfe the chiefe Biſhop and head thereof? Moreouer in the moſt approued Councils, the greateſt part of the pointes which we diſpute of, were not yet ſet out: for errors were not hatched, but by litle and litle, and they began to growe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, after that the tyrannie of the Pope was brought into the Church, who in like maner alſo played the tyrant ouer the Councils. Moreouer, we make a great difference betweene Councils and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils: for we willingly accept y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of Nice and ſuch like, becauſe that the worde of God gouerned there, the which worde God alwayes accompanieth with his Spirite. But we doe not ſo receiue the ſecond Councill of Nice, where Idoles were eſtabliſhed, were the holy Scripture was alledged as it were in mockerie, and which by conſequent coulde not be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with any other then the ſpirite of Satan. It is ſayde (ſay they) God created man to his owne image, therefore we ought to haue Images. Alſo no man
<pb facs="tcp:7934:67"/>lighteth a candle, for to hide it vnder a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell: Therefore we ought to ſet Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges vpon altars. Alſo God is named mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous in his Saintes: therfore we ought to beholde his glorie in Images. I aſke of them what man he is, that will reſt him ſelfe vpon a ſentence giuen vpon theſe proofes for Images? Nowe there are an infruite number of the like, where a man may plainely ſee the ſtyle of the ſpirite of Antichriſt, alleadging the Scriptures much worſe then Satan did to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. To be ſhort, if a man will not iudge in a Court, by former ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is there any reaſon to refuſe the ſelfe ſame order in matters of conſcience, and againſt the ſentences themſelues, that a man knoweth to haue beene giuen, the parties being therein neither hearde nor called:</p>
               <p>But admitte, that the holy Scriptures be the rule to compaſſe all doctrines: they will yet aſke me foran ende, in ſo great contrarietie which is amongſt vs, who he ſhalbe that ſhall expound and apply them: Concernyng vs, we are parties againſt them, and as couching them, they are
<pb facs="tcp:7934:67"/>parties againſt vs, who ſhall be iudge here then: for ſaye they, Let the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be ſo great a Iudge as men would haue it, yet it ſpeaketh not for to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and pronounce the ſentence. To this I anſwere, firſt that when a man is aſſured of the ſqueere in the meaſure, or of the compaſſe in the ſhippe, there is no Maſon ſo ſclender witted, which doeth not knowe in applying it, which is ſtraight, and which is crooked: nor Mariner ſo vnſkilfull, that doeth not perceyue, whether the ſhippe keepe her right courſe or noe. And therefore let them onely graunt vs, to guide the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes of our ſaluation, accordyng to the rule of ſaluation, conteyned in the olde and newe Teſtament, and we will therein ſubmitte our ſelues, not onely to a free and lawfull Councill, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to learned and vnlearned, to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and common people, and to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, for whoſe ſaluation it was written, who by them ſelues ſhall finde in this worde, the iudgement of the worde, and ſhall pronounce definitiue ſentence for the ſame.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7934:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Furthermore, in euery arte there are certayne principles and groundes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon vndoubtedly depende all the reſt. Geometry hath her Axiomes, Phyſicke her Aphoriſmes, and the Eiuill and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non lawe their generall rules, by which they will ſcanne all difficulties, which ſhal aryſe in their lawes. Nowe, ſay I, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie alſo hath her rules &amp; grounds, and the lawe of God, hath her certaine princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, able to decide al controuerſies which are amongſt vs: yea and thoſe ſo much the more ſtrong and eaſie, as we are moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that there is no kinde of doubt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, or contrarietie in them, to make them voyde or vnſtable.</p>
               <p>Nowe we haue three ſortes of differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or controuerſies with the Church of Rome: the one ſort conſiſteth in thinges playnely forbidden in the worde of God, the other in things which are not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the laſt in the interpretation of certaine pointes, which are eyther forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den or commaunded, which both of vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue, but diuerſly. Concerning the firſt kinde,<note place="margin">Acts. 4.19.</note> we haue a rule in the lawe of God, that we muſt rather obey God then man.
<pb facs="tcp:7934:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>This is ſo eaſie, that euen litle children may comprehend it. When then we ſhall ſee that men command one thing, and God another, we cannot doubt which we ought to obey. By this rule we cut of images, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, and all kinds of idolatrie which are committed in the Papacie, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely forbidden in an hundred places of the word of God.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ſecond we haue an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rule, God is the onely lawgiuer vnto his people.<note place="margin">Deut. 4. Ioh. 20. 2. Tim. 3. Matth. 15. Ier. 16.12.</note> Thou ſhalt not (ſaith he) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adde, nor diminiſh from my lawe. Chriſt ſaith, God will not be ſerued accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our traditions, but according to his commaundements. S. Iohn and S. Paule ſay, that the holy Scripture is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for our ſaluation. Chryſoſtom ſaith, Where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scripture holdes it peace,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in ſermo. de ſancto &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpirit.</note> there man muſt holde his peace. S. Hierome, Pratling without proofe of the Scripture ought to be of no credite. This is a rule commonly giuen to all peoples, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of alſo the people are capable. Let the people now read the old &amp; new teſtament, and let them marke if they finde any one worde directly or indirectly, ſecretly or
<pb facs="tcp:7934:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>plainely, which ſpeaketh nie or farre of, of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, of Purgatorie, of the inuocation of Saintes, and ſuch other points, which are in controuerſie betwene vs: Contrary wiſe if they ſhall not finde therein from line to line, that Chriſt is the onely ſacrifice once offered vp for all, that there is one onely waſhing in the bloud of Chriſt, that there is one onely God to be called vpon in the name of Ieſus Chriſt. If they finde there the doctrines which we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, then let them condemne vs, and cry fagot and fire againſt vs. If not, then let them be iudged by the rule which is afore touched, which they haue abuſed, and haue cauſed men to ſearch their ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in thoſe thinges, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Doctor of their ſaluation hath not taught them, &amp; conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they can finde nothing but deſtruction. Yea I ſay more, that if the learned would take paines to read (after the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) the doctors of the primitiue Church, they ſhal not find there any one word ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or if they do find any ſuch place, it ſhalbe in ſuch ſort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhalbe in more doubt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if they had ſpoken nothing. Whereof then they will of them ſelues conclude, (foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb facs="tcp:7934:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>as Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles haue taught nothing thereof, nor the primitiue Church hath beleeued nothing, nor they that came long after haue written any thing but that which is doubtful) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe are ſuch things, whereof we ought not onely to doubt with the doctors, but alſo whereof the Church ought to keepe ſilence with Ieſus Chriſt. As for example, <hi>400.</hi> yeres after the death of Chriſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church knew not what it was to call vpon Saintes, there was not found one word in the auncient writers, vuleſſe it were for the condemnation of thoſe, which did it according to the imitation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims, in ſeruing their gods.<note place="margin">Auguſt. de cura pro mortuis ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendo. Auguſt in euchirid. ad Laurentium cap. 67. &amp; 68. lib. de ſide &amp; operibus ſi ad Dulc. q. 1. &amp; paſſim.</note> Of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the firſt doctors of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church ſpeake not one word. S. Auguſtine, who was long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſometimes ſaith that there was one, ſometime y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there might wel be one, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time that it was no great matter whether there were one, or whether there were none. And S. Gregorie, who was after him, he began to beleeue by certeine viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that there was one, and this was <hi>500.</hi> yeeres after the death of Chriſt. Of the Maſſe it was altogether like, for we may marke the beginninges, proceedinges and
<pb facs="tcp:7934:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>increaſe, peece by peece euen vntill our time: and yet forſooth theſe were made ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of our faith, and for theſe, men bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Chriſtians, for which euen by as good reaſon, they might haue burned all the primitiue Church. By this one onely rule therefore compriſed in a fewe wordes, and eaſie for euery one to vnderſtand, wee cutte of the Maſſe, Purgatorie, prayers for the dead, inuocation of Saints, the Pope, his pardons, indulgences, and almoſt all that hath troubled Chriſtendome for this long time.</p>
               <p>But to defeate this rule, they would drawe certaine places by the haire, to the end, to make vs to finde therein their lewd inuentions. As for example, It ſhall not be forgiuen in this world,<note place="margin">Matth. 12.31. Mark. 3.28 Luk. 12.10</note> nor in the world to come, <hi>Ergo</hi> there is a purgatorie, which muſt be vnderſtood, as S. Marke hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it by theſe words, It ſhal neuer be pardoned, according to the Hebrew phraſe. Alſo, if Moſes and Samuel were before me to pray for this people, I would not forgiue them. <hi>Ergo</hi> (ſay they) we muſt pray vnto Saints. Whereas quite contrary, by the plaine words of the text, a man ſhall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:7934:70"/>gather, that it is a vaine thing to call vpon them, and the meaning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is cleare: that as God ſaith, If Moſes and Samuel were aliue, and ſhould intreat as ſometime they did, for the ſinnes of that people, they were become ſo heinous, that yet he would not forgiue them. To be ſhort, euen altogether like as it was, that Ieremie in the chapiter aforegoing, when he had made earneſt prayer vnto God for the people, he anſwered him, that if Moſes himſelfe who was moſt deare vnto him, ſhould praye vnto him for this people, he would not heare him. Againe ſometime they haue certaine Allegories, to proue theſe matters by. But we demaunde of them whether theſe doctrines are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to ſaluation, yea or no: If they be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, then we haue another certaine rule, That the word of God is cleare to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For that ſame light it ſelfe is come downe from heauen for to teach vs, &amp; that hath it not done darkely, or about the buſh. The holy Ghoſt came downe vpon Chriſt in the likenes of a doue, and vpon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in great brightneſſe: their doctrine therefore was plaine and euident, and they
<pb facs="tcp:7934:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>were not doctors or teachers of darknes. Let them therefore alledge one plaine and manifeſt place, &amp; not bring places wreſted from their proper meaning, and altogether from the purpoſe, and we are readie to yeld vnto them. And this is the rule which S. Hierome gaue: That Allegories &amp; darke places proue nothing.<note place="margin">Hieron. in cap. 4. ad Galat. Auguſtin. lib. 2 de do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin. Chriſt. cap. 24.9.</note> And S. Auguſtine ſaith: That al that perteyneth to ſaluation is plainely and clearely ſet downe in the Scripture, and that that which is darke in one place, is plaine and cleare in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Auguſt. loco codem. Ambr. in Pſa 119 ſerm. 9. Baſil. lib 2. de Baptiſm. queſt 4.</note>Now as concerning the third point, we haue a rule which all the auncient fathers haue giuen vs: That the holy Scripture is the light to it ſelfe. And that which is darke in it, is plaine by it ſelfe in another place, and that therefore the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all matters, muſt be drawne from the conference of ſuch places, where they are handled. Beſides we haue two markes to direct our ſelues by, to which the whole Scripture tendeth: and they are, the glorie of God, and charitie towardes our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Moreouer we boldly admittte all the doctors of the auncient Church for the
<pb facs="tcp:7934:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>interpretation of matters belonging to this thirde kinde, namely in the places and treatiſes, where they expreſſelye handle them. And whereſoeuer they are or ſhall ſeeme to be contrary, we willingly referre therein our ſelues to euery man, according to his owne common ſenſe and meaning, that ſhal haue readde the holy Scripture. As for example, there is a controuerſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixte vs, whether theſe wordes, <hi>This is my body,</hi> be a figuratiue ſpeache or no. Firſt of all I conferre, or waye together the places of the Euangeliſtes, and I finde in Saint Luke: <hi>This Cuppe is the newe Teſtament in my bloud,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 12.</note> which cannot be expounded without a figure, and I knowe that fleſh and bloud, are both of like impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the Sacrament. Further I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the queſtion is here of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that this is the accuſtomable maner of ſpeaking, common to all Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>The rocke vvas Chriſt,</hi> this is one place: <hi>Baptiſme is regeneration,</hi> that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, &amp;c. Finally I finde in S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine theſe words: In figuratiue ſpeaches,<note place="margin">Auguſt. lib. 3. de doctr. Chriſt. cap. 15.</note> (ſaith he) alwayes keepe this rule: If it be a maner of ſpeach that according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> letter
<pb facs="tcp:7934:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>commaundeth thee to do y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is good, or forbiddeth thee to do that which is euil, ſtreight way thou mayeſt iudge, that there is no figure. For thou haſt found there the ſcope and butt of the Scripture, to wit, the glorie of God, &amp; charitie. But if thou ſhalt take it according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> letter, and it ſeemeth to commaund thee to do that which is euil, or to forbid that which is good, then thou ſhalt ſtreight way iudge, that in very deede there is a figure. For example, ſaith he, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you eat my fleſh and drinke my blood, you haue no life in you. According to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it ſeemeth that Chriſt commandeth vs a foule &amp; an heinous thing. This therefore (ſaith he) is a figuratiue maner of ſpeache, by which he commandeth vs to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the paſſion of the Lord, &amp; thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fixe in our memorie, that his fleſh was pierced and crucified for vs. When I ſee then, that it is in ſuch ſort figured, that S. Auguſtine himſelfe alledgeth it vnto vs for example of figuratiue ſpeaches, I reſolue my ſelfe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this with other textes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, conferred in like ſort together, proue ſuch maner of ſpeaches in the matter of the Supper, cannot be otherwiſe taken but fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiuely.
<pb facs="tcp:7934:72"/>Nowe by theſe rules then ſhal the matter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſupper, iuſtification of faith and workes, free will, and ſuch other be determined, which ſtand vpon the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the textes of Scripture, which both the one and the other would drawe to their owne meaning and intention.</p>
               <p>I demaunde then of euery Chriſtian man, what we may iuſtly attribute more to the iudgement of the auncient fathers: for where we haue a plaine forbidding from God, euery one will agree vnto vs, that men can doe nothing, and that there neede no interpreters. Againe, where we haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement from his mouth, there it leſſe behoueth: for where there is no text, there can be no gloſe. Thoſe matters then remaine, out of which theſe commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are taken, and interpreted diuerſly, in which we moſt gladly admit the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of the doctors of the primitiue Church, and the moſt notable in all ages. To conclude then this article, we ſay, that the infallible marke of the pure Church, is the pure doctrine therof duely adminiſtred: and the vndoubted touchſtone of pure doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, is the pure worde of God, conteyned
<pb facs="tcp:7934:73"/>in the holy Scripture, which God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to be the rule of his Church. That the ſame is perfect, and to be vnderſtood of thoſe that deſire their ſaluation, yea aſwell of it ſelfe, as conferred with it ſelfe: albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it for the decyding of controuerſies foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the ſame, we wyllingly admit the interpretations of the moſt auncient. Briefely, becauſe we finde not this puritie in the Church of Rome, but the quite contrary, neyther the lawe of God obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by made ſubiect to the wyll of the Pope and his vpholders: we holde the Church of Rome moſt impure, and we marke the Pope that gouerneth there, for a notable marke of Antichriſt, lyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp him ſelfe aboue GOD, for that he ſetteth the lawe of God, behinde his owne commaundements and vaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The ſpirite &amp; the worde are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ioyned together.</note>Ieſus Chriſt is the head of the Church, as of one body: not of that there, nor of this here, neyther of one nor of other, but of all Churches alike. Now this head is vnto the Church, as reaſon vnto a man: to wit, to rule, &amp; to guide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame by his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now ſo far forth as deſire doth obey reaſon, &amp; the body the head, man is in good caſe: his ſenſes, his mouings &amp; accions are in theyr perfection, &amp; there is nothing in him, which ſauoureth not the good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of reaſon. Contrariwiſe, when the deſire will caſt of obedience to reaſon, and wil not be ſubiect to his gouernement, but giueth it ſelfe to drunkenneſſe, riot, and all kinde of exceſſe: then entreth he into a diſtemperature of all his body, the vitall partes are therewith offended, he loſeth one member, &amp; one ſenſe after an other, ſight, hearing, and all the powers depart
<pb facs="tcp:7934:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>away from him. To be ſhort, by the iuſt iudgement of God, reaſon it ſelfe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is taken from him, becauſe he made no accompt to obey it. I ſay, that the ſelfe ſame may fall out, and many times doeth fall out in the Church. Now ſo farre forth as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church doeth obey vnto Ieſus Chriſt her head, he arkeneth vnto his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which is reaſon it ſelfe, &amp; followeth his gouernement, which is ſet foorth in the Scripture, ſhe can not erre in the path of ſaluation: ſhee is ſound, pure, and perfect: and alſo he taketh pleaſure to leade her, and inſpireth into her his holy Spirite, to the ende to inlighten her in the middeſt of darkeneſſe it ſelfe. But when ſhe treadeth his gouernement vnder her feete, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no accompt to hearken vnto him, but preſumeth to be wyſe ynough of her ſelfe, to gouerne her ſelfe: then is it no marueile if ſhe fall as it were in pieces, and loſe one ſenſe after an other, if her eyes leade her into the pit, and if the ſpirit of God aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don himſelfe and forſake her, becauſe ſhee made no accompt of the worde, with which he is inſeparably ioyned &amp; knit together. For as it is moſt certaine, that Chriſt doth
<pb facs="tcp:7934:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>not ſuffer his flocke to erre, ſo is it alſo as certaine on the other part, that he doth not accompt any for his ſheepe, but choſe which heare his voyce: and thoſe heare his voyce, which hearken vnto him, ſpeaking in the Scriptures, and making them clearely to vnderſtand his will. God hauing firſt ſent his Prophets, hath nowe in the ende ſent from heauen his owne worde, which hath ſayd to vs, <hi>Search the Scriptures:</hi> and this is that ſame worde alſo which hath ſent the holy Spirite to the Apoſtles. If we then wyll feele the Spirit, it behoueth that we heare the word, for the Spirit is ſent from the word: but the cleargie of Rome doe make no accompt of this word. In ſtead of hearkening vnto it, it will be heard afore it, in ſteade of obeying vnto it, it will make commaundements of it ſelfe, in reſpect of which, thoſe of Gods haue bene neglected: yea it hath aboliſhed &amp; cut of certaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements wholy, and that openly. It followeth then, that it can not boaſt neither of the ſpirit, neither of the leading thereof, foraſmuch as this ſpirite proceedeth from the ſending of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eſſentiall word, who hath left vs his word in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Scriptures. So
<pb facs="tcp:7934:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>we ſee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> a king wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to a parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end to make them obey his lawes, &amp; to diſtribute them to his people: but if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhal abuſe them, to the end to make it ſelf obeyed aboue the king, and the lawes themſelues, he will ſtraightwayes take his authoritie from it. Nowe God and his lawe, in reſpect of the Church, are farre greater then theſe: for there can be no proportion of that which is infinite, to that which is finite. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is it any wonder if he haue taken from the prelates of the Church of Rome, the gifts of his ſpirit, when they woulde giue authoritie to their vaine traditions, aboue the lawe it ſelfe, and that vnder the ſhadow of his Spirite?</p>
               <p>We ſay that the ſpirit and the word are inſeparably ioyned and knit together, and that without great ſacriledge they cannot be ſeparated, foraſmuch as Ieſus Chriſt, who is the word it ſelf, hath ſo taught vs. <hi>When that ſame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forter ſhall come,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Mat. 28.20</note> This he vnderſtandeth by the vertue of his ſpirite: but he had ſayd before in the ſelfe ſame verſe, <hi>Teaching them to obſerue al things vvhatſoeuer I haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,</hi> that is to ſay, my worde.

Concerning the olde, we ſee that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaw was kept in the Arke, vpon which God manifeſted his preſence vnto his people, when he gaue them counſell, and in all that time wherein the people for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke
<pb facs="tcp:7934:76"/>the lawe of God, to ſerue Baal, we ſee that God likewiſe aunſwered not vnto their demaundes, not vouchſafing to aſſiſt thoſe by his ſpirit, which made no accompt of his word. And as concerning the newe, <hi>Beholde my couenaunt that I make with them, (ſaith the Lord:</hi>

Neither ought we to ſaye, that this is to much to abaſe the ſpirite of God, to bring it backe to the worde. For this is alwayes to meaſure God by himſelfe, and this alſo is the onely meaſure that he hath giuen vs.<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.</note> For if ſpirites are to be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by doctrine, (as Saint Iohn teacheth vs,) and doctrine, (as we haue already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) by the worde conteyned in the holy Scriptures, it followeth then, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God muſt be conſidered in the holy
<pb facs="tcp:7934:77"/>Scriptures, the which were left vnto vs by the Apoſtles, and gathered by the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, to the ende that there wee might haue a liuely portraiture and drafte of the Spirite, who had taught the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles according to the word, to diſcerne the ſpirites of Sathan, who without any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of this worde, durſt teache falſe doctrines in the Church. The Church then is ledde by the Spirite of God in the vnderſtanding of his will, but in aſmuch as ſhe ſearcheth for it in his worde, that is to ſaye, to him that ſearcheth the will of the Lord in his word, the Spirite is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in giuen vnto him for an interpreter. But to thoſe that make no accompt of the text, there needeth no interpreter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to thoſe that neglect the worde, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe their owne inuentions, the Spirite of God is not giuen for an interpreter. For the ſpirite of man and the Spirite of God are not mingled together, vnleſſe that a man forſake his owne ſpirit, and his owne fancies, to be ledde and conducted by the Spirite of God. To all thoſe therefore that alledge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leading of the Spirite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the word, we wil anſwere with Saint

For as Chriſt hath fulfilled the Law and the Prophetes, ſo the holy ſpirite hath fulfilled the Goſpell. Now Chryſoſtome had in hand in this Sermon to extoll the Spirite, for there he taught that the holy Ghoſt ought to be worſhipped as the true God. And yet notwithſtanding, Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome thought it no abaſing to the Spirit, when he meaſured it according to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, no more then did our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt when he meaſured it according to the Lawe and the Prophets.</p>
               <p>They obiect vnto vs that GOD is ſure in his promiſes, and that therefore hee keepeth the couenaunt that hee hath made with his Church. We aunſwere, that in verye deede the worde of GOD endureth for euer: but in all theſe ſayd

And therefore we muſt not conclude, God is ſure: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church cannot erre. But much rather to ſay, Seeing that the Church er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſo greatly, and ſo oftentimes forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth hun, it muſt needes be that God is ſure in his promiſes, and full of mercye. For it is certaine that very often hee kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his couenaunt with her, how corrupt and diſeaſed ſoeuer ſhe bee, and euen then when ſhe prouoketh him to a diuorce, ſo as ſhe treadeth the contracte of marriage vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her feete, and when ſhe hath enlarged her bedde (as the Prophete ſayth,) to all commers, as it maye plainely be ſhewed in all times and ſtates of the Church.</p>

                  </note> they beginne it at Adam. This therefore is the place from whence we muſt beginne. God hauing created Adam, he forbad him to eate of the fruit of the tree of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and euill: that is to ſaye, He commaunded him to order all his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:7934:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>and deſires according to his holye will, and to ſeeke all his felicitie and all his knowledge, in this onely point of cleauing vnto God. If he did not, he ſignified vnto him by this that he ſhall die the death, that is to ſaye, he ſhalbe ſeparated, from God, which is the ſoule of our ſoule, as our ſoule is in our bodies. In this couenaunt we ſee a plaine condition. Adam altogether full of graces, as hee was then, loued ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to followe his fantaſie, then to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred according to the worde of God, and to hearken rather to the voyce of Sathan, then of his Creator. Iuſt puniſhment fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vpon him and vpon all his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, man remayning corrupted, not onely in his body and outward ſenſes, but alſo in his reaſon, and in his vnderſtanding, in ſuch ſort that reaſon it ſelfe, for the moſt part, ſerued to no other ende but to make them ſo much the more vnreaſonable, and vnderſtanding nothing, but to make them ſearche curioſities that might withdrawe them from their ſaluation. And yet for all this, we may marke, in our fooliſh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie, the conſtant loue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our Creatour, towardes vs his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy

This then was a conditionall couenaunt, broken of mans part, by the ſume of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt Adam, and repayred againe in the perſon of the ſecond, by the aſſured goodnes and onely bountie of the Creator. Now if this Church euen from her firſt roote was thus polluted, if from her beginning, euen then when ſhe was full of knowledge and ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie, and when ſhe enioyed the preſence of God, ſhe failed ſo ſhamefully, becauſe ſhe turned away from the worde of her God, to her owne deſires: can it be that any man nowe a dayes, in obſcuritie, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and vanitie, (wherein we are all borne,) can vaunt them ſelues, that they are able to walke vprightly without this worde?</p>

To be ſhorte, that this was an hereſie ſo neere to infidelitie, and a ſinne linked with ſo many ſinnes, that none other but the Sonne of the eternall God, by the only ſacrifice of his death, coulde be able to repaire and redeeme it.<note place="margin">Auguſt. li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:7934:80"/>great, cannot be able to meaſure what a great iniquitie that was, to ſinne, ſeeing it was ſo eaſie for him not to haue ſinned. For as Abrahams obedience is praiſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when he was commaunded to offer vp his ſonne, being a thing ſo hard, which notwithſtanding he obeyed: euen ſo alſo as great and as incomprehenſible a diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt it be in Paradiſe, where the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement had not any kinde of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

The diſobedience then of Adam proceeded from infidelitie, whereof it is, that he is father of all infidelitie, which ſince that time hath bene and is in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. See then for the firſt ſort of the Church, in which one ſhall ſee nothing but a growing and continuance from worſe to worſe, euen till the ſecond: as maye be ſeene in the corruption &amp; confuſion which was in the time of Noah and Abraham, and amongeſt the Iſraelites in Egypt, where GOD reprocheth them that they were beſtayned and defiled with all kinde of idolatrie.<note place="margin">Ezech. 20.</note>

To be ſhort, the Church of that time was thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen downe farre beneath that of Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria and of Sodom.<note place="margin">Iſai. 1. Ezech. 21.

In the middeſt notwitſtandyng of this horrible confuſion, God knew his Church: <hi>For if the Lorde</hi> (ſayth Eſai the Prophet) <hi>had not reſtored euen a ſmall remnant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſai. 1.</note>

                  <hi>Behold me Lord, &amp; my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> that is to ſay, the diſciples that thou haſt giuen me.</p>
               <p>Finally, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes would not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the wholeſome exhortations of the
<pb facs="tcp:7934:84"/>Prophetes, God would euen conſtraine them by his mercy, and therefore ſent them euen ſaluation it ſelf from heauen, to witt, Ieſus Chriſt his onely Sonne our Lord. But the Church behaued it ſelfe towards him euen likewiſe. He had no greater ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies then the Prieſtes, the Scribes, the Doctors, the Phariſees, that is to ſay, (as our aduerſaries ſpeake,) the cleargie, and thoſe which had the Lawe committed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and thoſe which ſeemed to be the light of the Iewiſhe Church. If he ſpake any thing of the reformation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, then ſaid they he would deſtroye the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: if of the grace of God by the Meſſias, then he blaſphemed againſt the Lawe: if of the kingdome of heauen, then he ſtrooke at the maieſtie of Ceſar: if he wrought any miracles, that was by the deuil: if he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Scriptures, then they demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him where were the letters of his Doctourſhip, reproching him, that hee was a Carpenters ſonne. To be ſhort, all their arguments againſt Chriſt, are euen the ſame that our maſters vſe againſt vs. We are the children of Abraham: we are the keepers of the Scriptures. It belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb facs="tcp:7934:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>to vs to expounde them: and not to you, who haue not receyued holy orders as we haue done. And yet notwithſtanding all this, theſe were they, that with their gloſes, traditions, and vnwritten verities, with their ſucceſſions, interpretations and councills moſt cruelly perſecuted him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the ſnatching him out of the hande of the heathen magiſtrate, who iudged him innocent, that they might crucifie him. Now I demaund of our aduerſaries, what they can require in the outward eſtate of a Church, that was not in this Church here. If it be antiquitie, they were from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham: If it were calling, they were Prieſtes and Scribes: If it be a place, this was the Lordes houſe: If it be a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill,<note place="margin">Ioh. 11.47.</note> this was ſolemnely holden againſt Chriſt in Ieruſalem, who was there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely condemned. Be it whether they conſider the aſſemblye of the people, or of the Prelates, this was the viſible Church. And yet they cannot denie but this Church hath moſt foullie erred in the matter of ſaluation, crucifying Saluation himſelfe, vnleſſe they will denie that Chriſt was our ſaluation. But the reaſon hereof is very
<pb facs="tcp:7934:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>apparant, which is, that they ſought him not in the Lawe and the Prophetes, but in their traditions, Caballs, or vnwritten ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities. For the ſhepheards in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fields knew him: and the paſtors of the people ſet their doggs vpon him. This alſo is the reaſon that they were likened to an earthly King, deuiding the kingdomes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth among their owne, whereof it came to paſſe; that there was not any one, which promiſed not himſelf acrowne, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouernment of ſome countrey, whereas they ſawe that the true Chriſt was poore, naked, euil intreated,<note place="margin">Ioh. 12.38.</note> not ſo much as promiſing to his a place to laye their heads in. To be ſhort, it is ſo farre of,<note place="margin">Iſay. 53.10.</note> that they ſhoulde haue acknowledged him for the true Chriſt, for that (as they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) they were the viſible Church, that if they had accompted any for ſuch a one, this ſhould haue bene an infallible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them that had readde the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">Iſay. 6.9.</note> that he could not haue bene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſt, foraſmuch as it was expreſſely foretold by the Prophetes, that they ſhould not knowe him. Behold then what is fallen out to the Iewes (ſayth Saint Paul,)<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>To whom be longeth the adoption, and the glory, &amp; the
<pb facs="tcp:7934:86"/>couenauntes, and the ordinance of the Lawe, and the ſeruice of God, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. Of whom alſo the fathers are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,</hi>

                  <hi>and of whom alſo according to the fleſh Chriſt himſelf came, &amp;c. To witt, that for hauing reiected the Lord of glory, their pouertie was made the riches of the Gentiles, &amp; their reiection, the reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world,</hi> In ſuch ſort, that God in ſteade of turning away from mankinde, for the blindneſſe of his owne people, hath taken occaſion thereby to adopt al peoples for his people. Let vs not ſay therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, that the Church cannot erre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that God is firme in his promiſes: but rather that God is truely ſure in his promiſes, and conſtant in his mercies, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as he maketh no diuorce with her, albeit ſhe hath abandoned him, and ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly played the harlot, ſo inlarging the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of his compaſſion towards mankinde, and turning his great wrath into ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable mercie: as at this day we ſee in our time, in the great number which he hath withdrawne, and dailye doeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe, from the Swyniſhe filthe of the Popedome.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7934:86"/>
               <p>It remayneth then nowe that we ſee,<note place="margin">That the Church vnder grace hath erred.</note> whether that the Chriſtian Church which is vnder grace, hath had any more ſpeciall grace not to erre: wherin we haue alwaies to call to our reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, that the Church at this day is vniuerſall, that is to ſay, ſpred throughout the whole world, and that the promiſes of God are not any longer tyed to any one place, or to any one people,<note place="margin">Actes. 10</note> but are ſtretched ouer all peoples and places, where he is ſerued and worſhipped. Nowe this vniuerſal Church hath goodly &amp; great promiſes: <hi>I wil make an euerlaſting coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant vvith them, ſaith the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 37.26.</note> 
                  <hi>I vvill put my ſanctuarie in the middeſt of them for euer.

Ieſus Chriſt alſo ſaith himſelfe: <hi>I vvill be with you vntill the ende of the world.</hi> Alſo,<note place="margin">Matth. 28. Ioh. 14.23. Ioh. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>I vvill ſend you my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit vvhich ſhal teach you all things, &amp;c.</hi> But to the ende that hereby we do not imagine, as the Iewes did, our ſelues to be a viſible Church, which is alwayes of one ſorte whatſoeuer ſhe doe, the condition is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
<pb facs="tcp:7934:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>added, <hi>If you ſhall heare my voyce, if you be my people, if you ſhall teache that vvhich I commaunde you, if you ſhall loue me and abide in my vvord.</hi> For if you ſhal not abide therein (ſaith our Lord) you are not my diſciples, and thoſe which are not his diſciples cannot boaſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are taught by his Spirite, to the ende not to be decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The prerogatiue then that is in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Chriſtian Church, is not that ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre in her particular parts, but rather that being vniuerſall, when one part doth fall, the other doth help it vp, and when the one doth goe aſtray, the other may bring it into the way againe, yea, and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar members do their dutie when the more apparant leaders of the Church do guide it to deſtruction. Againe on the other ſide, in that ſhe is vniuerſal, it ought a great deale rather to beat downe this ſame particular preſumption, of not being deceyued in the whole Church, foraſmuch as when there is a temple either ouerthrowne or prophaned, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſacrifices, as in times paſt, ceaſe not any more, but rather of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ruines &amp; remainders, others may be els where builded vp againe where there was neuer any ſuch. S. Paul
<pb facs="tcp:7934:87"/>feared leſt that the Serpent which ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Eue, through his ſubtiltie ſhould turne the Church of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Corinthians from Chriſt and his ſimplicitie,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.3.</note> if ſhe were turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from his Goſpell. He meaneth then that ſhe might erre. He alſo chideth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians, who after they had Chriſt drawne as it were liuely before their eyes,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.6. &amp; 3.1.</note> and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt them, that they were ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly carried awaye to an other Goſpell. This therefore is not onely a thing poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but a thing (I ſay) which heretofore hath come to paſſe, euen whiles y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles liued. To be ſhort, he warneth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,<note place="margin">2.

It could not be then, that ſhe erred in light matters onely, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter of ſaluation, foraſmuch as ſhe had receyued &amp; imbraced her perdition euen in the middeſt of her owne bowelles. The which thing if we ſhal marke by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, we ſhal finde that euery where, where Ieſus Chriſt ſowed the truth and the good graine, by the hands of his Apoſtles, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
<pb facs="tcp:7934:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>that watcheth, whiles that the huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſlept, ſowed there his darnell &amp; lying, and finally there ſo beſturred himſelfe in tilling &amp; plowing it, that he choked y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeede of our Lord in many places, vntill that he had brought to paſſe, that he was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for the maſter of the harueſt. The zeale of thoſe of the circumciſion, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of the Apoſtles, began that medley in the Chriſtian religion: S. Peter himſelf win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at it, S. Paul calleth this to make the Croſſe of Chriſt of none effect, &amp; S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine in many places calleth it hereſie. Now from hence it came, that the diſciples of the circumciſion, who went to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to many peoples of the Eaſt and of the South, there reared vp Churches in ſuch ſorte, that the doctrine of grace was mingled with the lawe, the ſhadowes with the bodie, whereof it is, that many yet doe hold circumciſion with baptiſme. I ſpeake nothing of the infinite hereſies which put vp their heades vnder diuers names, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their ſeuerall factions, but of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which then came to paſſe in the bodies of the moſt flouriſhing Churches, which afterwardes greatly encreaſed and multipled. On the
<pb facs="tcp:7934:88"/>other ſide, the people which were called from Paganiſme to Chriſt, then principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when the Church had ſome litle reſt, &amp; conſequently leſſe zeale, care, and puritie, comming out of ſuch a bottomeleſſe pit of Idolatrie, they coulde not altogether for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their old cuſtomes. They had builded many beautiful Temples to their Idoles, and it ſeemed a goodly thing vnto them, to dedicate them vnto Saints &amp; Martyrs. In ſtead of their hunting places, they honored the reliques of Saints: in place of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Mars, of Iupiter, of Ianus, they tooke pleaſure to haue thoſe of S. Paul, &amp; of S. Peter, &amp;c. And wheras they had a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, to make for their fathers y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> died, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſacrifices, lights, following y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Plato co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning purgatorie, they willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued it, leaſt they ſhould fal fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their humanitie, &amp; therin only changed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme. The paſtors ſome of them, becauſe they were come out from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame Paganiſme, thought it good, other ſome did beare with it, leaſt they ſhoulde at the beginning goe backe, hoping in time vtterly to remoue it from them, as S.

<pb facs="tcp:7934:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert their zeale &amp; humanitie into a better cuſtome.

Alſo, either to beleeue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the pope is head of the Churche, is not neceſſary to ſaluation, the which the decretalles allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the church of Rome, do allowe, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering it for an article of our faith, and the Councill of Trent hath confirmed it: or elſe the Councils which haue denyed him to bee ſuch a one, haue erred in the matter of Saluation, that is to ſaye, the firſt generall council of Nice, which made him but equall and like to the other patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes, the Councill of Sardis, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Carthage, and the vniuerſal Church for the ſpace of ſixe hundred yeeres. To be ſhorte, it muſt needes be that our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries confeſſe, either that their Church at this day holdeth that for neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, which is contrary to ſaluation: or els that the auncient Church, ſo long time was ignorant of that which was neceſſary
<pb facs="tcp:7934:93"/>to ſaluation, that is to ſay, her owne ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who hath refelled it in a plaine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen council: whereof it muſt followe that the Catholike church may erre in general councils, yea, and the Romane Church it ſelf, notwithſtanding the prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded See of Peter, &amp; moreouer that the Romane is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the auncient church, to which we deſire at this day to conforme our ſelues. Now if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pope &amp; the Romane church haue erred in matters of ſaluation, it followeth then that the Chriſtian viſible church may erre, &amp; that a man may ſeeke for the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof. But to them which knowe how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> councils of our time haue bene hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, as that before they haue bene aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled, the controuerſies haue bene concluded at Rome: &amp; that notwithſtanding all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments &amp; proofs they could make to the contrary, they haue paſſed things by their ſpeciall aucthoritie: &amp; knowing howe that ſame holye ſpirite, or rather that ſpirite of Satan hath bene brought from Rome in a Caſkat: &amp; moreouer, ſeeing they are ſuch that gouerne there, that there diſpute and conclude, it needeth not greatly, that men proue that ſuch aſſemblies may erre, but
<pb facs="tcp:7934:93"/>contrariwiſe it might be found a ſtrange thing, if they coulde conclude anye thing without error.</p>
               <p>But now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to theſe ſo vrgent and weighty proofs, they alledge vnto vs, that Ieſus Chriſt prayed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peters faith might not faile,<note place="margin">Luke. 22.</note> whereupon they conclude with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen triumph, that the Romiſh Church can not erre. Firſt, the matter is of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, for it is a queſtion concerning a great nomber of articles, for which, as for articles of faith, wee haue bene burned for the ſpace of theſe fiftie yeres, which haue no other foundation but this. It muſt bee therefore that this fundation be faſt &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtfull, if wee will not doe him open wrong, who hath taught vs our ſaluation. Adde alſo hereunto, that al the iarre of the Greeke and Eaſte Churches with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, doe depend wholly vpon this point. For if it can not erre, then they which are contrary to her, haue erred greatly. But theſe thinges are farre enough one from the other, (I haue praied y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy faith ſhould not faile, though Satan ſift thee) &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they draw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the church of Rome ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not erre. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, Ieſus Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:7934:94"/>prayed for Peter, and Peter yet after this prayer denyed him thriſe, truſting to much in him ſelfe, whereas he ſhould haue pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, &amp; acknowledged his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie: and hereof alſo it came, that hee that eſteemed more of him ſelfe then al his companions, ſhould ſtumble, and fall more ſhamefully then all they. The Churche of Rome therefore ſhoulde rather drawe this concluſion from thence, which is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the text: that as he, truſting to much to himſelfe, renounced God, and did worſe then all the reſt, ſo likewiſe it maye doe, when it is made to beleeue, that it can not erre. And therefore it ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that according to his example, it ſhould weepe at the crowing of the cocke, and acknowledge all the faultes thereof. Thirdly, if this followe, Chriſt prayed for Peter, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Church of Rome which is founded by him, can not erre: then muſt it followe alſo, that the Churches which were founded by the other Apoſtles, can not erre. For Ieſus Chriſt drawing neere to his Croſſe,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.20.</note> prayed moſt earneſtly for his Apoſtles, and for all thoſe, which ſhoulde beleeue in him through their preaching, to
<pb facs="tcp:7934:94"/>the end they might be one in the Father &amp; in him, that is to ſay, that they might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably knit vnto him. And yet the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Churche hath excommunicated them as heretikes, and hath holden them as cut of from ſaluation. It foloweth then, either that this concluſion is falſe: Ieſus Chriſt prayed, <hi>Ergo</hi> it can not erre, or elſe that hee ment the inuiſible Church, againſt which hell gates cannot preuaile. Fourthly, S. Paul vnderſtood not this ſubtiltie, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we ſee, that hee admoniſheth the Romanes, called from amongeſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that they ſhould not proudly aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce them ſelues againſt the Iewes, vnder this ſhadowe, that they were entred into their place.<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> For (ſaith he) the naturall branches were cut of through vnbeleefe, and thou art engrafted in by faith, and if God haue not ſpared them, take heede, leaſt he alſo ſpare not thee: that is to ſay, take heed that thou fal not from faith, as they haue done: he meaneth then, that he thought them not to be without the compaſſe of the danger. Neither did Cyprian likewiſe, writing to the clergie of Rome, ſaying,<note place="margin">Cypr. lib. 2. epiſt. 17.</note> That y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praiſe which S. Paul attributed to the Church
<pb facs="tcp:7934:95"/>of Rome, that their faith was made know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en throughout the worlde, ſhoulde be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their ſhame, if they did not perſeuer to inherite this faith. Nor S. Hierom alſo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith,<note place="margin">Hieron. in epiſt. ad Ruſticum.</note> That after that couetouſnes was entred into the Church, as it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Empire, the Law ſhould periſh from the Prieſtes, and the viſion from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Nor all the ancient fathers, when they tooke Rome for that Babylon in the Apocalypſ. &amp; for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeat of Antichriſt, as we ſhal ſee hereafter. And therfore they ſhould doe a great deale better to followe their olde gloſe vpon this place of S. Luke,<note place="margin">Luke 22. gloſſa ibi.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as in praying for him, he ſaith, O Peter, I haue kept thee, that thy faith ſhoulde not faile, euen ſo alſo comforte the poore weak ones by thy example of repentance, to the end, that by their ſinnes they fall not into deſpaire, but that they hope for mercye, as hath bene ſhewed vnto thee. Finally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all theſe foreſaide reaſons, betweent the Antecedent: <hi>Chriſt prayed for Peter,</hi> &amp; the conſequent: <hi>The Church of Rome can not erre,</hi> there are infinite thinges to proue, betweene theſe two ſentences, to wit, That S. Peter was head of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb facs="tcp:7934:95"/>&amp; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church: That he was at Rome: That he was B. there: That he particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly founded any church there: That he had this prerogatiue aboue the reſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he coulde not erre: That he either tyed it, or coulde tye it to that chaire, either for the popes, or for the Romiſh Church: The which things ought firſt to be plainely proued, before we can come to any ſuch concluſion. Let vs come then to ours, following our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and notwithſtanding their obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this place, let vs conclude with the holy Scriptures, and the practiſe of all times, this preſent diſputation. Our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath deliuered to his Church the holy Scripture, as a compaſſe to a ſhippe, for to conduct and guide it to Saluation. Looking vnto this compaſſe, ſhe can not be deceiued, for it ſheweth alwayes vnto her, her marke, whatſoeuer winde do driue her: and not looking vnto it, ſhe can not but erre, and goe out of the way, no more then all the pilots or Shipmaſters of the world together know, without a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, to keep their courſe one only houre. To y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churches which follow his worde, he hath promiſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the preſence of his ſpirit.
<pb facs="tcp:7934:96"/>From theſe which make no accompt of it, he withdraweth him ſelfe, accompting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnworthy of his preſence, which diſdaine to harken to his voice. Hereof it is, that the Church in all her eſtates and places hath greatly erred &amp; gone out of the way: but more this then al the reſt, which hath bene more bold to intermedle w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leading of the worde, &amp; which hath moſt preſumed of her owne abilitie, to witte, the Romiſhe Church. If ſhe haue no other priuiledges and promiſes then the viſible and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church, there is no doubt but ſhe may erre. For we haue ſeene by her owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that ſhe hath erred euen in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſaluation, in her moſt notable me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <head>That the Pope, or Biſhop of Rome is not head of the vniuerſall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, by any right of the lawe of God. CHAP. VII.</head>
               <p>WHen we demaund of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, vpon what their traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are founded, which they make equall with the articles of our fayth, which haue not anye ſhewe of foundation in the holye Scripture: they anſwere vs, that they are the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Church. If hereupon wee will beate them downe, alledging that the Church muſt be gouerned after God his will, conteyned in his woorde, and that ſuch doctrines are not agreeable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: they reply, that the Church can not erre in the matters of Saluation. If wee proue farther vnto them by the diſcourſe of all times, that often tymes ſhee hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned the pure ſeruice of God, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her owne inuentions, euen vntill ſhee hath bene defiled with al abhominable ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries: they reply, that the Romiſh church hath this particular priuiledge, that it can
<pb facs="tcp:7934:97"/>not erre, becauſe it is S. Peters ſeate, the head of the Apoſtles, &amp; of al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church. And therfore by this meanes all the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in a maner, that we haue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, come to be brought to this queſtion: Whether the B. of Rome, or the ſea of Rome, (for they are different in themſelues) be head of the church.<note place="margin">Concil. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantienſe.</note> In this quality, there is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the pope, power to change the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt in the Sacraments, to change according to the time, the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the holy ſcripture, to make newe articles of the faith,<note place="margin">Deciſiones rote.</note> to derogate from the olde Teſtament, &amp; from S. Paule his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, as the vicar of Chriſt, &amp; ſucceſſour of S. Peter. This then according to their iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, is an article of great importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to ſaluation, vpon which all other articles neceſſarie to ſaluation are founded. In the ſelfe ſame quality, iuriſdiction is giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him ouer all the Eaſt churches, &amp; to cut them of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the Church, &amp; to leaue them for a pray to the Turk, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not acknowledge him. To be ſhort, it is come to this point, that he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelf king of kings, to eſtabliſh em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires at his own wil, to ſet out kingdomes
<pb facs="tcp:7934:97"/>for a pray, to diſpence with ſubiectes for their othe made to their prince. This ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is an article, not onely belonging to the ſaluation of euerye Chriſtian particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, and to all in generall, for that ſame vnion which is ſo much commended vnto vs: but alſo neceſſarie to policie, to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience due to magiſtrates, &amp; to the whole life of man. But nowe wee ſee that Ieſus Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles haue deliuered vnto vs the articles of our faith, the doctrine of the Sacraments, &amp; of the obedience which is due to our ſuperiors, in plaine &amp; expreſſe termes, and thoſe very often repeated in many places. It followeth then, that this article, by the which new articles of faith are eſtabliſhed, the changing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the ſetting vp &amp; depoſing of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the ſubiecting of heauen and earth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of one onely man, muſt bee there plainely ſet foorth. Nowe if it be not there expreſly conteined, one of theſe two things muſt folow, either y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Lord &amp; his apoſtles took pleaſure to hide theſe things fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, to make a math &amp; confuſion of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth together, which to thinke were verye execrable blaſphemie: or elſe
<pb facs="tcp:7934:98"/>it muſt bee altogether falſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all that is builded vpon it, muſt quite fall downe, and bee vtterly razed to the ground. Nowe I doe adiure euerye one, euen as they loue their ſaluation, that they weygh wel the proofes of this article. For if the very foundation of the popiſhe doctrine, which is this here, haue no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in Chriſt, it followeth that the pope hath layd another fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation in the Church then Chriſt, contrary to that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.</note> and by conſequent that hee is none of thoſe, which hath builded vpon the foundation of Chriſt, woode, haye &amp; ſtone, but the Antichriſt him ſelfe, which hath ſetled him ſelfe in the place of the chiefe corner ſtone, which is the onely fundation of the Church.</p>
               <p>We ſay that Ieſus Chriſt is the head of the Churche: our aduerſaries ſay that it is S. Peter in his ſucceſſors, or rather the pope, and the Church of Rome, becauſe of S. Peter his ſeat. Now as we haue found the body out of the Scriptures, to wit, the church,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.23. &amp; 4.16. &amp; 5.23.</note> ſo likewiſe we ought not to ſearch for the head any where elſe. S. Paul ſaith that Chriſt is the head of the church, &amp; the
<pb facs="tcp:7934:98"/>church the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of him which hath accompliſhed all in all. Alſo that Chriſt is the head of the Churche, as the huſband of the wife, and the Sauiour of his body.<note place="margin">Col. 1.18. Rom. 12.5.</note> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, wee which are manye are one body in Chriſt, &amp; euery one of vs are me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers one of another. Theſe places are ſo cleare, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> our propoſition can not be denied. Thereupon they will graunt vs, that Chriſt is the head of the Church: but they will ſay, that there muſt be a head, and generall lieutenant in the gouernment thereof: &amp; that this is S. Peter in his Succeſſors, whome they call for diſtinction ſake, the miniſterial head of the Church. This is it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they muſt proue vnto vs by plaine textes, for wee flatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">S. Auguſtine vpon theſe words, eny kingdome is not of this world. The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt are the faithful which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him. Rom. 14.</note>Firſt of all, we muſt not here imagine an earthly kingdome. For Ieſus Chriſt hath taught vs, that his kingdome is not of this world: &amp; if his be not of this world, then much leſſe ſhall his be, whoſoeuer ſhal enterpriſe to be his lieutenant. This lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenantſhippe then is neither temporall nor ſecular, neither can it be ſtretched ouer the empires of the earth, neither can the B. of Rome in this qualitie call him ſelfe the
<pb facs="tcp:7934:99"/>Monarch or onely gouernour both of the ſpiritual &amp; temporal. But as the kingdom of Chriſt is ſpiritual, to wit, the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ſoules of the faithfull, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he fedeth by his word, (as S. Paul ſayeth, that it is peace, ioy &amp; righteouſnes through his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) ſo muſt it be likewiſe, that the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration or gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts muſt be ſpiritual, to wit, the miniſtery of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, from whence proceede thoſe forenamed effects: much leſſe ought we to imagine an earthly king. For Chriſt is the Sonne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eternal God, who ſtileth euery thing w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his power, who by the vertue of his ſpirite is preſent to all thinges, and is preſent with thoſe that conſent in his name to the ende of the world. He needeth not therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lieutenant, as doe other earthly prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for to winne the heartes of his people: for theſe are the effectes of his Spirite, giuing efficacie to his worde, the which no man, how great &amp; holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſoeuer he ſeeme, can attribute to him ſelfe. And if they finde it ſtrange, that our Lord by his ſpirite, in that he is God, doth gouerne his Church, foraſmuch as he hath promiſed ſo to doe: Let them not thinke it more ſtrange, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we
<pb facs="tcp:7934:99"/>deny his corporall and carnall preſence in their maſſe, which he hath not inſtituted.</p>
               <p>Againe, here is no queſtion of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which may be gouerned by a lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant alone: but of preaching the Goſpell throughout the whole worlde, of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling al the people of the world by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word vnto God: in a woorde of the Miniſterye of the Goſpell, which conſiſteth in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring the worde and Sacraments in all places. Nowe it is certaine, that no man can accompliſh this, but onely he, who is the worde it ſelfe, and the alone ſacrifice, becauſe that with his manhode hee hath Godhead, and power that is infinite.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.25.</note> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can none but he, bee the Biſhop of Biſhoppes, the Paſtour of Paſtours, and the high Prieſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.20. &amp; 7.26. &amp; 9.11.</note> and none can bee this Miniſteriall head, or Lieutenant in his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. But rather euery Biſhoppe and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor amongeſt his flocke, may repreſent Chriſt in exerciſing his charge, without acknowledging of the Biſhop of Rome to be aboue him, as hath bene moſt largelye diſputed by Cuſan the Cardinall in the time of the Council of Conſtance.<note place="margin">Card.

               </p>
               <p>That which they alledge of Moſes and
<pb facs="tcp:7934:100"/>Aaron, that they were heades, the one of the common wealth, &amp; the other of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, whileſt yet God walked in the middeſt of his people, is but naughtely drawen into a conſequence. For beſides that there was the expreſſe inſtitution of God in their perſons, and in the ſucceſſors of Aaron for the ſeruice of God, there was this other thing in it, that it was but a litle countrey, and in that countrey one onelye Citie Ieruſalem, and in that City but one Temple, where men ought to ſacrifice, ſo that there one gouernour and one high Prieſt might ſuffiſe: in ſteade whereof, the whole world, by the comming of Chriſt the Meſſias, is become one Temple, and al the people but one flocke, which muſt be fedde by the worde of God, a thing that no one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may preſume to do. Not that I would denye, but in the heart of one Pope, there may bee ambition enough to couet the whole world: for this were to deny y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth of all hiſtories: but rather I woulde ſaye that there was not any one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that was not ready to haue forfaited &amp; loſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crown, if he failed to inſtruct by the preaching of the word of god, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt dioceſſe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world.
<pb facs="tcp:7934:100"/>Of this allegation then, they conclude no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to their aduantage, vnleſſe they wil become Iewes, &amp; encloſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world in one Citie, &amp; make voyde the benefit of the death of Ieſus Chriſt which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to al the world. But contrariwiſe we may by the way drawe this conſequence: That ſeeing Moſes (as they ſay) was head of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale, and Aaron of the ſeruice of God, that the Pope ought to content him ſelfe with the one, without farther inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling with the other, to the preiudice of all the princes &amp; kings of the earth. Nowe if they replie, that they are able ynough to exerciſe the eſtate of the generall lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantſhippe of Chriſt throughout y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world, without calling them to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> practiſe which yet neuer was ſeene, I demaund whether this be by the ſpirit of Chriſt, or by their owne. If by theirs, why then, this is the ſpirit of the prince of this world, for to couet and not to conduct: and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Church, which is left to be guided by the vaine ſpirite of theſe men, who thinke themſelues to haue ſuch abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance. Nowe if it be by the ſpirite of Chriſt, I do require the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either that they will agree,
<pb facs="tcp:7934:101"/>that this ſpirite following the promiſe of Chriſt to his miniſters, doeth giue power to the miniſtery of the worde pronounced by them, whereof followeth that euery Biſhop and paſtor in his miniſtery, occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieth the roome of Chriſt viſibly: or elſe that they proue vnto vs by fit &amp; agreeable texts, that Chriſt hath encloſed the roote of his ſpirite ſo in the heart of the Pope, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none can be partaker of it beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. To be ſhort, the kingdome of Chriſt conſiſteth in this, that he gouerneth his owne, giuing power to the preaching of his worde, and to his Sacramentes by the vertue of his ſpirite: and the miniſterie of his Goſpell, conſiſteth in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of that worde, and of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes. Nowe there is not any man that can boaſt to giue and diſpenſe the holy Ghoſt, for he proceedeth not but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Father and the Sonne: None then, vnleſſe it be Chriſt, God and man, can be the eſſential head of the Church. Likewiſe no man can preache the woorde, &amp; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the miniſterie throughout the world: none therefore can bee the Miniſteriall head of the whole Church: But rather
<pb facs="tcp:7934:101"/>eche miniſter &amp; paſtor in his owne right, vnder the Paſtor of paſtors Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde.</p>
               <p>Nowe let vs come to that which our aduerſaries ſay, that Saynt Peter was the miniſteriall head of the Church. If he were ſo, they muſt needes graunt that this was by the inſtitution of Chriſt: for otherwiſe, and without his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he would neuer haue preſumed to haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon him ſuch a dignitie. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if our Lorde haue placed him in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch degree, and ſo neceſſary as they ſaye, for the Church: they will graunt me that Saynt Peter hath exerciſed this office: for otherwiſe it had bene to leaue the Church for a pray and confuſion. If then Chriſt haue not inſtituted it, nor S. Peter exerciſed it, it muſt followe, that he was neuer the miniſteriall head of the Church.</p>

Agayne, when they were ſent foorth to preache,<note place="margin">Luk. 22.30</note> they went two by two, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, which excludeth all ſuperioritie. When Chriſt promiſeth that they ſhall iudge the twelue tribes of Iſrael,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.30</note> ſitting vpon twelue thrones, he giueth not him a place aboue the reſt to gouerne in.

               <p>Againſt theſe places playnely denying and forbidding the primacie, they alledge vnto vs that which Ieſus Chriſt hath ſaid vnto Peter. <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:7934:106"/>certayne that Chriſt is the eſſentiall head of the Church, but yet that Peter is the Miniſteriall head, that is to ſay, that he is likewiſe called ſo by reaſon of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie. But we demaunde in what place either of the Scriptures, or of the fathers them ſelues, they finde this. And we haue alreadie proued, that there can be had no miniſteriall head which is the ſelfe ſame thing.

If they can not, then it followeth, that all the Apoſtles were miniſteriall foundations, as well as he, and not founded vpon him, and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe muſt it be of all the Churches which were founded by them: as Saint Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome ſaith vpon the ſeconde Chapter to the Galatians.

<pb facs="tcp:7934:107"/>we further drawe two contrary propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

If we knowe what is meant by the keyes, and what it is to binde and to looſe, it wilbe eaſie for vs to iudge, whether of theſe two propoſitions be true. Chriſte Ieſus pronounceth, Wo be to you Doctors of the lawe,<note place="margin">Luk. 11.51</note> becauſe you haue taken away the keye of knowledge: ye haue not entred in your ſelues, and thoſe which woulde wyllyngly haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in, ye haue forbidden.

This therefore was rather a conſolation for his infirmitie, then a marke of dignitie. Saint Auguſtine, who was otherwiſe curtous inough, found out no other meaning of this place.

That this then ſhoulde be the office of loue, to feede the flocke of our Lord, ſeeing that that was the

<pb facs="tcp:7934:116"/>It followeth then, either that the Pope is Chriſt, or elſe that he cannot be any other, but he who woulde aduaunce himſelfe to that place in the Church, to wit, Antichriſt.

Alſo he learned nothing of Peter, nor of the reſt, but contrariwiſe he taught Peter, and they conferred not any thing to him, but he rather conferred and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited Peter.

In all companies there is a chieftie of order, but that doth not therefore import, that there ſhoulde be a chieftie of power, nor any ſuperioritie in reſpect of the one ouer the other. In the empire of Germanie, there are ſeuen Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. The Archbiſhop of Mentz, and the
<pb facs="tcp:7934:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>Countie Palatine are the chiefeſt, the one amongſt the Eccleſiaſticall perſons, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ciuil. Haue they therfore power ouer their fellow Electors, to wit, ouer the other princes that haue not that degree? That is a toye. Alſo there is no wel gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned aſſemblie, where ſome one is not preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to propound the matters they haue in hande, to gather the voyces, to pronounce ſentence according to them. Shall ſuch a one therfore eſtabliſh and diſpoſe all at his pleaſure? all the worlde will ſay contrary. Alſo Peter was preſident among twelue perſons, &amp; that by the electio of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles, and not otherwiſe. Whoſoeuer therefore will conclude, that it is very good, that in all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies there be ſome one to gouerne their actions, and to keepe order, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion ſhalbe very good. But that therfore the Pope as his ſucceſſour, ſhould gouerne ouer all the worlde, this ſhould be no more order, but the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion of the whole world. Moreouer, as it hath bin notably diſputed long ago againſt the Pope, If S.

For Saint Iohn myght haue had better ſucceſſours then Saint Peter, all which together, myght haue had power to chooſe one to gouerne. And theſe are thoſe perſonall dignities, which deſcende not from the father to the ſonnes, and are not tyed to one chaire, but depend vpon the common conſent of thoſe which haue inſtituted them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which Cardinall Cuſan durſt well ſaye,<note place="margin">Card.

But contrariwiſe we finde great coniectures that he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer there, of which wee were not the firſt ſearchers out, but the greateſt perſonages that were in many ages before vs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the death of our Lorde,<note place="margin">Marſil.

By the holy Scripture it appeareth,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. &amp; 2.</note> that Peter was at Hieruſalem twentie yeeres after. From thence he came to Antioch, where Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſayth, that he was ſeuen yeres, and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius ſayth <hi>25.</hi> He that ſhall beleeue Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, he coulde not be martyred vnder Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, though he himſelfe ſaye it. For betwixt the paſſion of Chriſt &amp; the death of Nero, there was but thirtie ſeuen yeeres, and by Euſebius accompt, there muſt be at the leaſt xlvi. yeeres. And if we ſhall beleeue Gregorie, there remaine but ten yeres, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time Peter could be at Rome. But foraſmuch as Peter and Paul were
<pb facs="tcp:7934:120"/>ſeene in Ieruſalem, S. Paul writing a long Epiſtle to the Romanes, woulde he haue abſtayned from him, if he had bene there then? Likewiſe he ſaluteth a great nomber of perſons, without making any mention of him. Beſides he writeth many Epiſtles from Rome, in ſome of which, a man ſhal finde ſome places, that neceſſarily ſhould haue made mention of him. And in one place he complayneth, that all had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken him, beyng a priſoner for the Goſpel.<note place="margin">Phil. 2.20. 2.

If before, (as their legend ſayeth, that Saint Paul arriued there after) &amp; that they two together had ſuch combats agaynſt Simo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Magus, whence commeth it, that Saint Paul did not ſalute him in his Epiſtle to the Romanes? Whence alſo commeth it, that he maketh no mention of him, in the other Epiſtles? and which is more, whence commeth it, and howe can that accorde to that which S. Luke ſayeth in the Actes,<note place="margin">The laſt Chapter of the Actes.</note> That the Iewes ſayd vnto Paul, that they
<pb facs="tcp:7934:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>had vnderſtoode nothing of him, and they deſire him to declare vnto them his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that ſect, agaynſt which euery man ſpake? Is this credible vnto any, that S. Peter, who came thither before, and was the Miniſter of Circumciſion, that he had taught them nothing of him? Alſo whence commeth it,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. Galat. 2.</note> that S. Paul, who is wont diligently elſe where to rehearſe their meetings, as when they mette at Antioch, maketh no mention of this meeting, being in one of the moſt famous Cities in the worlde?</p>
               <p>Nowe if Saint Peter came thither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Saint Paul, beſides that it is a great maruell, that no mention is made thereof, yet then the legende is falſe, whereupon the primacie is founded: and as it is falſe in one poynt, ſo it may be in another. Moreouer the Legende ſayeth, that they were beheaded both together, and the Canon ſayeth, the ſame yere, in the ſame daye, and at the ſame hower.

And yet for all that they are ſo impudent, that they will drawe all ſtaye of the Chriſtian faith, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the faith of a lying legende. Nowe agaynſt theſe proofes, they can alledge but one place of Scripture, whereof they may be aſhamed, to witte, that which is in the later ende of the firſt Epiſtle of S. Peter: <hi>The Church which is in Babylon ſaluteth you:</hi> I wyll not denye vnto them, that Euſebius, and Beda,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. 2.</note> and Saint Hierome hath interpreted the date of this letter to be from Rome: but I do rather willingly accept that which they confeſſe, that they are not able to aucthorize the See of Rome by the ſcripture, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by acknowledging it to be called Babylon, euen by their pretended founder himſelf.

                  <pb facs="tcp:7934:123"/>that this is a common &amp; receyued opinion, that S.

<pb facs="tcp:7934:123"/>that right which he had. Againe, why ſhoulde they not rather haue choſen Paul for their Biſhop, ſeeing that it appeareth by the holy ſcripture,<note place="margin">Acts. 10.</note> that he had preached there a long tyme? Moreouer what will they anſwere to the Biſhoppe of Antioch, who is more clearely founded in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then the Biſhop of Rome, that is to ſay, euen in the expreſſe text of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? for, alledging that goodly reuelation of tranſlating Peters See fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Antioch to Rome, which is read in Gratians decretal,<note place="margin">12. q. 1. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus.</note> they ſhalbe derided, as for an idle dreame. And what will they anſwere to S. Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie himſelfe, who ſayth that the Biſhops of Alexandria and of Antioch, are aſwell Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſucceſſors as he of Rome, &amp; that they ſitte in Peters chaire? If as an Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Gregor. in Regiſtr. 99. ad Eulog.

Hierome)
<pb facs="tcp:7934:124"/>to the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Galat. 1.</note> and placing the other by the ſingular prouidence of God in Iurie. Whereupon it wil folowe then, that by the ſame right, all places where Peter hath preached, ſhall haue a primacie, that is to ſay, there ſhalbe primacies and popedomes without nomber, and ſo conſequently not one alone. Alſo, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſucceſſion of Rome ought rather to be taken of Paul then of Peter:<note place="margin">Hieron. in Epiſt. ad Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat cap. 2.</note> for Rome is of the Gentiles.

In this council, where they had time enough to dreame all their forbidding, yet ſhall you not finde that the primacie was founded vpon anye lawe of God: much leſſe, that which they call the fulnes of power. And in very deede, for to decide the matter, men were not ſent to ſearch the ſcriptures, in which S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine (who was preſent there) was wel able to haue found it, if it had bene there, but rather to the foure originals of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cill of Nice, which were kept in the foure pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchall Sees.

To conclude, the Emperours haue called generall Councils, &amp; the patriarks and. Metropolitanes, thoſe that were Nationall and prouincial. They that were Patriarkes euery one was preſident ouer the See of his patriarchſhippe, and not the Biſhoppe of Rome, nor his deputies in general councils. The patriarks or chiefe Biſhoppes went not to ſeeke their Palls
<pb facs="tcp:7934:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>at Rome, but were Canonically elected o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thoſe places. The Biſhoppe of Rome (as appeareth by thoſe Epiſtles them ſelues of Gregorye the great) when hee was choſen,<note place="margin">Greg.

Eche one of them had an Eccleſiaſticall iudgement ouer his owne, and none appealed from them, no not the Biſhoppes them ſelues beyond the Sea, who had no Patriarke in the Sea of Rome. I demaunde then by what marke they can ſhewe vs that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy in the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Primitiue church, be it, but by the poſitiue lawe of man: And yet notwithſtanding wee ſee the courſe from time to time, and from Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill to Councill, vntill the yeere of our LORD ſixe hundred and more, when Phocas the Emperour killed his maſter Maurice, and inuaded the Empire: and to get fauour of the Romanes, after ſo curſed and deteſtable murther, gayned Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the third, their Biſhop, declaring him to be head of the Church, and Biſhoppe of Biſhoppes, againſt that that Gregory his predeceſſour had a litle before ſo hotelye

<pb facs="tcp:7934:142"/>The Emperors of Conſtantinople driuen away, the Lombards thereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did inuade the kingdome of Italie. The Pope more feared them, then thoſe whom he had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen away, becauſe that they were his more nie neighbours. At that time there gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Fraunce the race of Martel, very deſirous to aſpire. The Pope therefore putteth himſelfe into the protection of the Frenchmen, againſt the Lombards, and Pepin the ſonne of Martel, he paſſeth into Italie with the powers of France, who vanquiſheth them. The iſſue was, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Pope Zacharie in reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence, diſpenſeth with the Frenchmen for theyr othe made to theyr natural prince Chilperick, who left the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Martels, more ſubtil then himſelfe, and crowned Pepin chiefe of the palaces of the king of France, forbidding the princes and people of France, vpon paine of excommunication, to chooſe any other then of Pepins race. Contrariwiſe, Pepin giueth vnto him the dukedome or lieutenantſhip of Rauenna &amp; Pentapolis, which contained <hi>29.</hi> Cities,<note place="margin">C. Adrianus d. 63. &amp;c.

And ſo likewiſe behold him the head of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualtie, becauſe he mainteyned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> murtherer of his maſter and temporall Lord, becauſe he crowned a ſubiect in the place of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural prince: &amp; this beginning of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraltie grewe vp by the controuerſies of the houſes of Aniou and Arragon in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and afterwardes of the Emperours of Germanie, and of the kings of Fraunce, till it came to that ſtate wherein we nowe ſee it in theſe laſt times.</p>
               <p>This was after the time that the key of knowledge, which Chriſt promiſed to S. Peter, was changed into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> key of power, &amp; the eccleſiaſtical cenſure was employed to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate all princes, peoples &amp; king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes which would not obey them, vntill they had left them for a pray, and cut them of from ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without acception of any perſons. This was in that time, that theſe gaye interpretations were bred: <hi>That all povver vvas giuen to Chriſt by the father, aſvvel in heauen as in earth:</hi> Therefore the

To be ſhort, one hath concluded and decided at Rota, that is to ſay, in the Parliament of Popes at Rome, that God holdeth for wel done, all that is done of the Pope: that his will is the rule of all right and righteouſnes: that he can abſolutely do in this world all that God can do, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is all and aboue all thinges: That if he change his purpoſe,<note place="margin">Deciſiones Rotae.

And yet one man hath gone further, for one hath diſputed whether he may ordeine any thing contrary to the Goſpell: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he haue not yet more power then S. Peter: Whether he were ſimplie a man, or as God. To be ſhort, the deuil hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo far in this myſterie of iniquitie,<note place="margin">Eraſmus in 1. epiſt. ad Tim. cap. 1.</note> that one diſputed in the ſchooles a litle before Luther came, and ſomewhat after, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope participated not with both natures, the diuine &amp; humane with Ieſus Chriſt. And what could the deuil ſay more if he had come in the fleſh to haue deſtroyed the Church: And yet notwithſtanding the people do worſhip this monſter, &amp; the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth do clap their hands at him, &amp; deſtroy their kingdomes to ſerue his luſt, &amp; ſacrifice yet euery day their poore ſubiects
<pb facs="tcp:7934:144"/>for a ſacrifice of a ſweete ſmelling ſauor at his feete. Who would haue beleeued this, except the Spirite of God had foretold it: and who will beleeue it after vs, when the ſelfe ſame ſpirite ſhall haue deſtroyed him? But which is more marueilous, when the power of the biſhop of Rome was intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, he neuer durſt alledge in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills, and in the face of the old Church, one only text of Scripture to grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy on. And now y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is ſo much beyond the bounds, that it ſpurneth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth vnder feete thereof, that it threatneth heauen, that it aduaunceth it ſelfe ſo farre that it may be aboue God himſelfe, they are ſo impudent and ſo ſhameleſſe, (but ſo ſhe muſt be that is an harlot) that they alledge S. Peters See, and the word of God, and the keyes which were promiſed to him, as though there were no more eyes in the world to reade, nor ſenſe in men to iudge. Let them not therefore ground their tyrannie vpon this, (<hi>Dabo tibi,</hi> I wil giue thee) which Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſpake to S. Peter: For betwene the kingdome of Chriſt and the tyrannie of the Pope, there is no likenes or agreement. But rather, if they wil ground themſelues
<pb facs="tcp:7934:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>vpon ſome text of Scripture, let them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Tibi dabo,</hi> I will giue thee, which ſathan vſed to Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>I wil giue thee</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>all the kingdomes which thou ſeeſt, if thou vvilt worſhip mee.</hi> That is for worſhipping the deuil, they haue that they haue, and not for any other title they can alledge.</p>
               <p>But I ſuppoſe, that nowe with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of all the Readers, I maye conclude by theſe proofes conteyned in theſe two chapiters, that which followeth: That the eſſentiall head of the Catholique Church is Ieſus Chriſt our Lord: That vnder him all the Apoſtles were equal in dignitie and power: That after them the biſhops are equall amongſt themſelues, &amp; euery one in his Miniſterie occupieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of Chriſt: That none may be the Miniſteriall head of the Church: That the Pope of Rome can pretend this title, neither by Gods law nor mans: That y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt roume that he had, was by reaſon of the dignitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie, but that all that was more, was from the deuill and by vſurpation. Whereupon it followeth, that in regard of the miniſterial head of the Church, he could not pretend to be leſſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
<pb facs="tcp:7934:145"/>to error, then other biſhops and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes, neither the latine Church leſſe then thoſe of Greece &amp; others of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eaſt. And ſo we returne, notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding their exception, to our former co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion: That the articles grounded vpon the authoritie of the Pope and the church of Rome are ouerthrowne, and al their traditions &amp; inuentions ſubiect to the examination of the holy Scripture, as are the doctrines of all other Churches.</p>

               <head>That the Pope in affirming himſelfe to be head of the Churche, and not being ſo in deede, is the Antichriſt in the Church: and that he cannot be receiued vvith any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then the papiſtical doctrine. CHAP. IX.</head>
               <p>THE Pope not being head of the Church, as he ſaith he is, and hauing no other titles to prooue this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Lieutenant ſhippe which he ſo proudly exerciſeth, we ſaye that he is the plague of the whole body, a tyraunt in the common weale, &amp; Antichriſt in the church. And for to prooue this, I will not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the particular explication of thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, which are in Daniel,<note place="margin">Daniel.</note> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> epiſtle
<pb facs="tcp:7934:145"/>to the Theſſalonians, &amp; in the Apocalypſe,<note place="margin">2. Theſſ. 2. Apoca.</note> which in times paſt were darckened, but now are made cleere. For alſo many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, not onely of our time, but <hi>300.</hi> yeres agoe, haue made thoſe bookes plaine amiddeſt the ignorance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, &amp; cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Pope. But I ſaye, that although he were not ſo liuely painted out vnto vs, as he is in thoſe foreſaid places, yet his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine ought to make vs knowe, that he is the very Antichriſt, with whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church was threatned, and that there could not be in Chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dome any thing more pernicious then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doctrine which he hath brought in.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to take away al doubt, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaketh vnto vs of many Antichriſts. For euery hereticke which ſetteth himſelfe againſt the truth, he is in very deed an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt: but it ſpeaketh vnto vs of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, who ſhall haue his ſeate in the Church of God, and ſhall vſurpe Gods place: who as Origen ſaith,<note place="margin">Origen Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 30. in Matt.</note> muſt be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great Antichriſt among other Antichriſts. This is he of whom we haue now to ſpeake.</p>
               <p>Secondly when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scripture ſpeaketh of Antichriſt, it ſaith, that it ſhalbe an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie or a falling backe from the faith. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
<pb facs="tcp:7934:146"/>that that myſterie of iniquitie began to worke in Paul his time,<note place="margin">2. Theſſ. 2.</note> and that it ſhould no otherwiſe be deſtroyed, but by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Ieſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Apoca. 13.15.16.17.</note> Againe, that he muſt builde his greatnes, vpon the ruine of the Romane Empire, and giue life to that loſt beaſt, that is to ſay, as all the auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue expounded, to this Empire, and namely S. Auguſtine in the xx. booke of the citie of God:<note place="margin">Aug. lib. 20. de ciuitate Dei, cap. 19. Chryſoſt. in epiſt. ad Theſſ. Ho. 2.</note> &amp; Chryſoſtome vpon that place, where S. Paul handleth this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And we knowe that the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire fell by litle &amp; litle, and peece by peece. It foloweth then that Antichriſt is not one man alone, which muſt come at one inſtant of time, but is an eſtate, ſeat and ſucceſſion of men, an Empire lifted vp againſt Ieſus Chriſt: as we ſee the Scripture, vnder the name of certaine beaſtes, to deſcribe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires. And this alſo is the interpretation of S. Auguſtine vpon that place.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Antichriſt is called that falſe prophet, vomiting out blaſphemies againſt the moſt higheſt. His Empire therefore conſiſteth in falſe doctrine, &amp; not in armes: he is called a woman &amp; an whore: he ſhall therefore wind in himſelfe, and come in by
<pb facs="tcp:7934:146"/>pleaſaunt wayes, ſleightes and flatteries, deceyuing men through his crafte, &amp; draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to his ſpiritual whordome, which is idolatrie. He is alſo called the ſonne of perdition, as Iudas. Againe, he ſhall not aſſayle the Church by open force, but he ſhall betray her with a kiſſe, and ſhall not enter by the breach, or by a ſtrong ſcaling ladder, but by counterfaiting the keyes by painted Emblemes, and ſecretly like a thiefe. And in very deede the Empires which conſiſted in forces and armes, they are figured in the ſcriptures vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of Wolues, Lyons, Beares, and ſuch other rauening beaſtes, whereas for this, ye haue but women, whoredomes, cuppes, drinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, enchantments, that is to ſay, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, crafts, and ſubtilties: whereupon the ſchoolemen themſelues haue conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that this chiefe Antichriſt, which is here deſcribed, can neither be Mahomet, nor the Empire of the Turkes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he is properly called <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> and not <hi>Antithee,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Chriſt the Mediator, and not ſimply againſt God: therefore particularly he ſhal be againſt Chriſt Ieſus our Lorde. And all
<pb facs="tcp:7934:147"/>the doctrine of Chriſt conſiſteth in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Mediatorſhip, &amp; in the benefit of his death and paſſion. This then ſhall be the ſpeciall doctrine that he will chiefely labour to aboliſh. It is oftentimes ſaide, that he ſhall ſitte in the Church of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there acknowledged as God. Nowe it is certaine, that if he ſhoulde ſay that he were Chriſt, or ſhoulde preach directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, the Church would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this in the middeſt of her, nor ſuffer him to raigne.<note place="margin">Apoc. 13.11. Mat. 7.15. 2. Cor. 11.14.</note> It is likewiſe ſaid, <hi>That he ſhall haue tvvo hornes like to the lambe, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notvvithſtanding as the Dragon,</hi> that is to ſay, he ſhall counterfaite the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and holineſſe of Chriſt, although he ſpeake nothing but impieties, as Satan doeth. It foloweth therefore, to make theſe markes to agree together, that it muſt be that Antichriſt, of whom nowe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie is, that he muſt ſpeake in ſhewe as Chriſt, but in deede and in effect againſt Chriſt, and honoring him in wordes, and yet as much as lieth in him, robbing him of his glorie. And that he is the true Antichriſt, of whom the queſtion is, who vnder the ſhadowe of
<pb facs="tcp:7934:147"/>Chriſt, ſhall ouerthrowe his doctrine, and put him ſelfe in Chriſt his place, Saint Auguſtine handling this matter, doeth no otherwyſe vnderſtande it.<note place="margin">Auguſt in Epiſt. Iohn. tract. 3. &amp; 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Let vs not regarde</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the tongue, but the deede: Antichriſt is a lyer, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth profeſſion of Chriſt, and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth him in effect.</hi> And a litle after, <hi>Howe ſayeſt thou that I denye him in effect? Becauſe Chriſt</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>is come in the fleſh, to the ende that he ſhould die for vs.</hi> Chryſoſtome ſayth,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in Mat. Homil. 49.</note> 
                  <hi>That he muſt be knowen by his doctrine, and neyther by titles, miracles, nor wordes of holineſſe.</hi> Saint Hilary ſayth,<note place="margin">Hilar. ad Auxenti.</note> 
                  <hi>That Antichriſt ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be contrary to Chriſt, vnder opinion of an hypocriticall and faigned godlineſſe.</hi> And in another place, <hi>O ye fooles, who are mooued and rauiſhed, and caught in loue with woordes, and gorgeous ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges of Churches: Doe ye doubt, that this ſhall one day be the ſeate of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſte?</hi> It behooueth vs nowe therefore to conſider, who it is that ſitteth in the Church, who ſpeaketh more of Chriſt, and leaſte eſteemeth him, who more honoureth him with trayterous kyſſes,
<pb facs="tcp:7934:148"/>and blaſphemeth more againſt his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, who in the chaire of Chriſt, is more againſt Chriſt: for this ſame vndoubtly is the true Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Let vs begin at the perſon of the Pope. Chriſt hath declared that his kingdome was not of this world,<note place="margin">The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Pope, and the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Antichriſt.</note> that he fledde, when they would haue made him a kyng, that he rendred obedience euen vnto the leaſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and commaunded all thoſe that were his, to doe after his example. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe the Pope ſayth, that he is king of the whole earth, diſpoſeth of all Empyres, treadeth Emperors vnder his feete, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with fyre, and condemneth to hell all thoſe that wyll not acknowledge him for ſuch a one. And all this, becauſe Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Al power is giuen to me of the father, aſwell in heauen as in earth:</hi> I aſke of any one, what ſimilitude and likenes there is betweene theſe two, and if this be not, in alleadging Ieſus Chriſt, to mocke Chriſt himſelfe? Againe, Chriſt being God, and the ſonne of the eternall God, vouchſafed to abaſe himſelfe lower then Angels, and vnder men themſelues to worke the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the worlde: and a man quite
<pb facs="tcp:7934:148"/>contrary lyfteth vp himſelfe aboue kyngs, and aboue the Angels, and aboue the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens of heauens, and hath cauſed men to diſpute, that he is not ſimply a man, but a partaker of the diuine nature with Chriſt, and that he hath the fountaine and roote of the ſpirite of Chriſt in him. To be ſhort, whereas Chriſt ſubmitted himſelfe vnder heauen, earth and hell, he will commaund Kings, Angels and deuils: and all this, vnder colour of the key of the word, which Chriſt hath deliuered to his miniſters. I aſke, God being made man for the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the worlde, howe it can be, that this man, which maketh himſelfe God, ſhoulde be any other, then that ſonne of perdition, come for the perdition of the worlde?</p>
               <p>But we muſt ſee, howe he hath aſmuch as laye in him, made voide the comming of the Meſſiah, the croſſe of Chriſt, and the ſaluation we haue by the ſame. We feele in our ſelues, that man continually doeth nothyng but offend God, and that it is as poſſible for vs, of our own nature, to keepe our ſelues therefrom, as to ſtay our pulſe, or to holde in the winde of our breath. Theſe offences alſo are ſo infinite, being
<pb facs="tcp:7934:149"/>and blaſphemeth more againſt his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, who in the chaire of Chriſt, is more againſt Chriſt: for this ſame vndoubtly is the true Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Let vs begin at the perſon of the Pope. Chriſt hath declared that his kingdome was not of this world,<note place="margin">The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Pope, and the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Antichriſt.</note> that he fledde, when they would haue made him a kyng, that he rendred obedience euen vnto the leaſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and commaunded all thoſe that were his, to doe after his example.

               <p>But we muſt ſee, howe he hath aſmuch as laye in him, made voide the comming of the Meſſiah, the croſſe of Chriſt, and the ſaluation we haue by the ſame. We feele in our ſelues, that man continually doeth nothyng but offend God, and that it is as poſſible for vs, of our own nature, to keepe our ſelues therefrom, as to ſtay our pulſe, or to holde in the winde of our breath. Theſe offences alſo are ſo infinite, being
<pb facs="tcp:7934:150"/>committed againſt him which is infinite, that they deſerue an infinite puniſhment, whereto all the men in the world together are not able to ſatiſfie. It muſt needes be therefore, that the ſonne of God in perſon muſt deſcend from heauen, to ſatiſfie by his infinite merite, for our infinite demerites: and not one man coulde euer hope for the mercie of the Father, if his iuſtice had not bene executed vpon his owne ſonne. This is that which all the holy Scripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, that Chriſt was ſent for the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worlde: that he is the onely and alone Sauiour thereof: that he was ſlaine from the beginning of the worlde, for the ſaluation of thoſe that beleeue in him, &amp;c. And this is it wherein conſiſteth all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of the comming of Chriſt, and all the treaſure of the Church. But ſee howe this good gouernour of the Church diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth with this: Firſt of all he hath bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the ſcripture in forgetfulneſſe, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the readyng thereof vnto the people, leauing them nothing but Roſaires, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends of Saints, and ſuch other baggage, that is to ſay, aſmuch as lyeth in him, he hath put out the light, to the ende that his

And what would haue bene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende of theſe blaſphemies, if men had not reſiſted them? Do we thinke there would haue bene any mention of Chriſt in our dayes: I doe not tell you any fables. The bookes that men made foure hundred or fiue hundred yeeres agoe, are full of ſuch like doctrine, which hitherto they dare not diſalowe. Theſe were the readings

And yet further, beholde the abſolution they gaue to their penitentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: <hi>The paſſion of Chriſt, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the bleſſed virgine Marie, of Saynt Peter, of Saynt Paul, and of other hee Sayntes, and ſhee Saintes of paradiſe, be vnto thee in remiſſion of thy ſinnes:</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Franciſcane Fryers do inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ioyne Saynt Frauncis with Ieſus Chriſt.

               <p>But as the Pope and his ſupporters had turned away the people from Chriſt, to the virgine Marie, and from the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Marie, to the Apoſtles, and from the Apoſtles, to olde Sayntes, and from the olde Sayntes to newe, whom they haue canonized according to their fantaſie, and

The bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, ſhed vpon the tree of the Croſſe, is the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the ſinnes of all thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him. This is the onely marke of all the olde and newe Teſtament. But the Pope, the contemner of all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, bare the worlde in hande, that he was the treaſourer of this great raunſome payde for our ſinnes: And that to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker thereof, we muſt come vnto him: And he will diſtribute this benefite to whom he thinketh good. And thereupon euery man began to bye ſaluation of him, which the onely bloud of Ieſus Chriſt had purchaſed for vs, and no other thing could purchaſe it. If thou hadſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the faultes in the worlde, thou mighteſt haue had recourſe to the Popes pardones and indulgences.

The doctrine of Chriſt was: He that ſhall beleeue in me, ſhall haue remiſſion of ſinnes. That of the Popes: Hee that ſhall giue mee money, there ſhall be no hell for him.

He
<pb facs="tcp:7934:162"/>ſayth there in plaine termes, <hi>That in the Pope and his ſhauelings, there is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fayth, godlineſſe nor trueth: That the Popes chaire, is the chaire of lying: That this is a falling awaye of a people, which vnder the banner of Chriſt rebell againſt Chriſte, and fight for Satan: That they eſteeme the Goſpel but for fables, and the promiſes of the life to come, for dreames. He compareth the Pope to Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, who betrayed Ieſus Chriſte with a kiſſe: and his clergie to the Iewes, which ſayd vnto him, Aue Rex Iudaeoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Al haile king of the Iewes: his prelates to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies, who in mockerye clothed him with purple, and afterwardes crucified him in the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Caluery.</hi> And after he ſayth: <hi>Denie it nowe if thou canſt, that thou art ſhe which the holy Euangeliſt Iohn ſawe in the ſpirit, ſet downe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the great waters. Thou art, &amp; none other, that Babylon, the mother of the whoredomes of the earth: Thou art drunken vvith the bloud of the Martyrs of Ieſus.

<pb facs="tcp:7934:163"/>in their heartes. To be ſhort, the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſpirits that the worlde brought forth, in the moſt ignorant ages, and in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thicknes of darkenes, they perceyued this, ſome more clerely, and others as it were through a clowde, vnleſſe it were ſome ſuch as ambition and glorie of the worlde had blynded: Inſomuch that when abomination was come to his full toppe, God rayſed vp Iohn Hus, Hierome of Prage, Wickliefe, Luther and others, which haue ſo lowdly publiſhed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed it, that all the worlde doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it. And what will we more: With leaue of thoſe good Fathers of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill not long agoe holden at Trent, we may make this Syllogiſme.</p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer wilbe called the vniuerſal Biſhop, he is the forerunner of Antichriſt, the father of the ſonne of pryde, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lucifer, ſaith Saint Gregory y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope, and principall Doctor of the Church of Rome.</p>
               <p>But Boniface the thirde his ſucceſſour, tooke this title, they which followed him, haue continued it, and haue encreaſed it more &amp; more. And the Councill of Trent
<pb facs="tcp:7934:163"/>excommunicateth all thoſe, that will not acknowledge him for vniuerſall Byſhop.</p>
               <p>Ergo the Pope is Antichriſt, and al they are holden for excommunicate by the Councill of Trent, that doe not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him for Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Yea, but the clergie of Rome wil ſay, If the Pope were the Antichriſt, whereof the Church was before threatned, we which are the Church, ſhoulde haue knowen him. Contrarywiſe, I ſay vnto you, that if you had knowen him for Antichriſt, he had not bene Antichriſt. This is that which the Phariſes ſaide when Chriſt came: If this were Chriſt, who ſhoulde knowe him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then we: We haue the Church, we haue the Scriptures: we are the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters therof: We are the eyes of the people: It cannot eſcape vs, that we ſhoulde not knowe it. And yet in meane time the counſel of Hieruſalem condemned &amp; cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Meſſiah for a deceiuer, &amp; the great Rabbies and Maſters, with an infinit nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the people, a little while after, follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame miſerable Barcoſba to ruine &amp; deſtruction, and acknowledged him for the true Meſſiah.

                  <hi>Who hath beleeued our word? and to whom hath thine arme bene mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted? They haue eyes but they ſee not. They haue eares but they vnderſtand not. The Lorde hath blynded their eyes, and hardened their heart &amp;c.</hi> And nowe I ſay vnto you, that the ſelfe ſame is come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, vpon you (I ſay) who boaſt of the name of the Church, in the knowledge of Antichriſt. For he is come with all the ſignes &amp; wonders, that the ſpirite of God hath foreſhewed vnto vs, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame place, at the ſame time, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame way, &amp; in the ſame apparell. There is nothing that doth not agree vnto him, neyther that can agree to any other, but to him. In meane time the Church, that is to ſay, the Romane clergie, haue receiued him for their Spouſe. The Council of Trent haue declared him to be God in earth, excommunicating al thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wil not cleaue vnto him: and the princes of the earth haue lent him their armes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute, and to murther thoſe who woulde make him knowen to the worlde. And wherfore? Becauſe this word of God muſt be fulfilled, which he hath ſpoken by the
<pb facs="tcp:7934:164"/>mouth of his Apoſtles:<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2. Apoca. 14. &amp;. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>He ſhall ſit in the Temple of God, boaſting himſelfe as if he were God. He ſhal make dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k al the kings of the earth.</hi> He ſhall abuſe &amp; deceiue all the world, becauſe they haue not loued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth. God ſhal giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp into a ſtrong illuſion, to the end they may beleeue lies. And euen lyke as the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cil of Hieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned Chriſt, ſo the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cil of Trent haue appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Antichriſt. The clergie crucified ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelfe: &amp; the clergie hath adored their perdition. The great doctors of the lawe were therein blynd, becauſe Chriſt ſhewed them a ſpiritual kingdome, in ſteade of the temporall that they waited for: And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romiſh Church haue taken plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſhutte their eyes, becauſe Antichriſt hath brought them a temporall kingdome, wherein they intend to dwel. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding death, the croſſe, and the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of all the worlde, the ſpirituall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt was victorious ouer all the kingdomes of the earth. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the temporall kingdome of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, &amp; all his adorations, and conſpiracies of al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings &amp; princes of this world, which labour to vphold him, it muſt needs be, that
<pb facs="tcp:7934:165"/>he be deſtroyed by the breath of Chriſt his mouth, and that he fall, and vtterly periſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of our fathers</note>They demaunde hereupon, What then became of our fathers, after ſo long time that this tyrannie of Antichriſt came into the Church? Of the great Rabbies and maſters who aſke this queſtion, I aſke them what they haue done therein, of them, I ſay, who had their ſoules in keeping, and who had taken charge, and who knew wel howe to heape vp great riches, &amp; to builde them gaye houſes? I aſke alſo againe of them, what became of the poore people of all the Eaſt Churches, who were farre greater then the Latines, whom the Pope by his excommunications ſent to hell by whole millions, for the ſpace of ſixe or <hi>700</hi> yeeres after that? To be ſhort, I may ſend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to that which our Sauiour ſayth, that when the Sonne of man ſhall come to deſtroye Antichriſt by the Spirite of his mouth, it ſhall be as the dayes of Noah, or of Lot in Sodom, that there ſhalbe no more, neither fayth nor loue in the worlde. But to the poore people who haue bene deceiued by Antichriſt and his
<pb facs="tcp:7934:165"/>mayntayners, I aunſwere after another ſorte.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that this falſe doctrine of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, came not in all at once, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by little and little, till it grewe to his full meaſure and heape, ſo as it was not ſo deadly in the beginning, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the ende thereof when it came to his ſtrength. But when it was moſt ſtrong, and in the greateſt ruffe, God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes reſerued many in al cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, which mourned vnder his tyrannie, yea and ſome alſo that cryed out as loude as they coulde, by theyr wrytynges, as we haue already ſhewed. And in deede xxv. yeeres agoe, one woulde haue ſayde that there was not ſo much, as one to be had in France which knewe Antichriſte, and his doctrine. And yet notwithſtanding, at the firſt liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which was graunted to the townes, they were founde verye full of ſuch people.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as our aduerſaries make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene the Church and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſnatching the name of the Church onely to the prelates, which ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Chriſtians: ſo we likewiſe do
<pb facs="tcp:7934:166"/>well put a difference, betweene the people cleauyng to the Churche of Rome, and the faction of Antichriſte, betweene them who liue vnder the popedome, and the vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and maintayners of the Pope: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the enchanters, &amp; thoſe that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted: betweene the Phariſes, whome Chriſte calleth generation of vipers, and that poore ſicke woman, whom he yet cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the daughter of Abraham. We ſaye that among that poore people, which was ſo long tyme deceiued vnder the darkneſſe of Antichriſte, there was a parte of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye of the viſible Church: But that the Pope and his mainteyners are the bane of it, which ſtyfleth and choketh theſe poore people, as much as lieth in it. We ſaye that this was the Church of Chriſte, but that Antichriſte helde it by the throte, to the ende that that ſaluation and life which floweth from Chriſte, might not be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vppon it: That it was a flocke of Chriſt, but gouerned partly by hyrelings, and partly by woolues. In the people we conſider y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> members of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vniuerſall church: but in the ſcabbes &amp; infections which doe hide them, we marke the poyſon of the
<pb facs="tcp:7934:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>papacie: and in their buddes, the whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes that the church of Rome hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with Antichriſte. To be ſhort, we ſaye that the people were of the Chriſtian common weale: but the Pope with his fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a proud ſeditious Catiline, to deſtroy and to ſet it on fire: whom Cicero very wel calleth a plague, and not a member of the common weale. And in deede, as of euill dyet, and ſuperfluitie there is engendred in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s body an impoſtume, (which yet not<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>withſtanding is not the body, nor any part of the body, but a diſeaſe, and very often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the death of the body) euen ſo, ſayth Saluſt, that of the ſuperfluitie of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, Catiline was bred: euen ſo we ſaye that of the delightes, ſuperfluities, and idleneſſe of the Church of Rome, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſte is bredde in it, who yet is neyther the Church nor any part of the Church, but is the diſeaſe and peſtilence it ſelfe of the Church, which had ſo infected and feſtered the whole bodie, that there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no more health nor ſoundneſſe therein, and had bin altogether the death of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, had not God of his ſingular mercie opened the ſame vnto vs.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7934:167"/>

But that GOD hath giuen grace to ſome to abſteine from it, to ſome in tyme to vomit it vp againe, to others to mingle it with the meate, and to certaine to ouercome it by the ſoundnes of their complexion: in ſuch ſort that many haue dayly eſcaped it, notwithſtanding his accurſed intention and purpoſe.

               <p>When it pleaſed God to giue vs grace to know the falſe Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion of the Pope, by vertue whereof he made himſelfe head of the Church, and that by examination aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of his doctrine, as of thoſe markes which he ought to haue, we found euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this is the Antichriſt, &amp; none other:
<pb facs="tcp:7934:169"/>they, who were called to preach the trueth, haue preached in the Church, they which had charge to teache, haue declared &amp; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it by bookes, and many to whome God gaue zeale &amp; courage, haue proteſted it alowde and clearely, euen amiddeſt the flaming fire. Some haue ſhewed it to the people and common weales. Some cryed it out in the eares of princes. Some haue offered to verifie the impietie of his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in a free generall Councill.<note place="margin">In Concilio Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſi.</note> In the Councill, in ſtead of diſputing by the holy Scriptures, they haue refuſed the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: in ſtead of hearkening to their quick reaſons, according to faith, they haue bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them quicke againſt the faith. And to the ende, they ſhoulde neuer haue occaſion to hope for a free Councill, and ſhould not dare vnder the ſafe conduits of any to come thither, they haue paſſed therein an article, <hi>That faith and promiſe is not to be kept with heretikes.</hi> Afterwardes all this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, we haue alwayes required a free Council, where they haue condemned vs without euer calling for vs. Some haue anſwered vs for all: That theſe were mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters done long ago, whereof we ſhould not

Therfore following the example of the Apoſtles, when they were exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Iewiſh ſynagogue for hauing preached Chriſt: we haue begun to gather our ſelues together to ſerue the Lord, firſt ſecretly &amp; in corners, &amp; afterwardes more freely: &amp; neither can we communicate with thoſe Idolatries brought in by Antichriſt, nor at the firſt daſh driue him from his ſeat, for that the Princes of the earth with their power vpholde him: &amp; therefore we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to deliuer our ſelues, &amp; all thoſe that wil hearken vnto vs, from his ſeruitude &amp; bondage. Nowe I aſke, what our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries can finde fault with in this our doyng, either in the matter it ſelfe, or in the maner of our proceeding? If they looke vpon the matter, we ſepara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t our ſelues not for light matters, but for manifeſt idolatrie, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king voyd the croſſe of Chriſt, for perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:7934:170"/>which reigneth in the place of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. To be ſhort, we withdraw our ſelues from this prince of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion, who is reuolted back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Lord. And we report vs euen to their own iudgement, whether they thinke it not lawful to ſeparate our ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of Antichriſt, ſitting in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chayre of Ieſus Chriſt. For if euery one wynke therat, who ſhal diſcouer him? and if euery one cleaue vnto him, who ſhal chaſe him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? and if all the world hold their peace, where is the ſpirit of the mouth of the Lord which ſhal deſtroy him? Nowe if they ſhall deny y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is Antichriſt, we wil ſubmit our ſelues to proue it, &amp; then there is no queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our ſeparation, but of our doctrine. If they will reproue vs for the maner of our proceeding, therein condemning vs, they condemne the Apoſtles, who hauing ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne all Iſrael, ran into a thouſande dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to the end they might make Chriſt to be receyued into his owne houſe, &amp; in the middeſt of the temple: &amp; finally, perceyuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be ſtopped euery way by open force, by exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munications, impriſonments, &amp;c. they receyued him ſecretely into their priuate houſes, and did preach him in ſmal
<pb facs="tcp:7934:171"/>aſſemblies, till at laſt they brought all the worlde into his ſubiection. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, they crie out, that wee haue broken the Communion of the Church: that we haue ſet altar agaynſt altar: that we are Schiſmatikes, &amp;c. which were the outcries of the Phariſes againſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, You violate the Temple, the altar, the lawe, &amp;c. And hereupon kings and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons haue armed themſelues on all ſides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. This therefore is the thing that we muſt preſently make anſwere vnto.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church.</note>Firſt, the Communion of the Church doeth not conſiſt in a locall vnion, neyther the ſeparation, in remouing of places: For there are a great many without, if we looke to the place, who yet are within according to charitie, and many againe in place, that yet if we conſider faith, are without: but the true Chriſtian Communion conſiſteth in the vnion of faith, and in the vnion of charitie, which S. Auguſtine calleth the nereneſſe, or rather the neyghbourhoode and dwelling together (as I may ſay) of hearts, and agreement in doctrine: and the true ſeparation, in the diuerſitie or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietis of the ſelfe ſame things. Nowe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:7934:171"/>the vnion of faith, it conſiſteth in that heauenly doctrine, which is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended vnto vs in the olde and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tending onely to this poynt, to make vs feele our ſinne, and to ſhewe vs a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die therfore, in one onely Ieſus Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. And this is that, for which, according to the example of all the auncient ſeruants of God, we ſuffer and are killed, and for withdrawing our ſelues from vnder the yoke of Antichriſt, that ſhamefully trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it vnder his feete, we are perſecuted, excommunicated, and murthered. We are therefore vnited in the faith, with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes, Prophetes, Apoſtles, Martyrs, auncient Doctors, and generally with the whole Church that was before the lawe, vnder the lawe, and vnder Grace, yea and vnder the tyrannie of Antichriſt. If they will denie it, we wil ſubmitte our ſelues to proue it: There is not therefore any more queſtion to cauill at our ſeparation, which is nothing elſe but as an eſcape, to the ende to reſort to true doctrine: and if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it, denying vs to be vnited with them, they confeſſe then, that they are not vnited with the ancient fathers, and therfore they
<pb facs="tcp:7934:172"/>ought not to thinke it ſtraunge, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the communion of the Papacie.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Communion of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or loue, which conſiſteth in ſuffering and bearing the euilles one of another, &amp; in not lightly condemning one another: we holde all them for the true members of Chriſt, which worſhip one God in ſpirit &amp; in trueth, and hope for their ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in one Ieſus Chriſt alone, the ſonne of God come in the fleſhe, and crucified for the ſinnes of the worlde, which is the foundation of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to all men.

Contrary wiſe euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knoweth, that the Popes Conſiſtorie hath exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated al the Eaſt Churches, <hi>600</hi> yeres agone, only for this, that they would not ſubmit themſelues to the Biſhoppe of Rome, which is an article that concerneth
<pb facs="tcp:7934:172"/>only but his ambition, and that the Pope hath left them to be inuaded of the Turke, in deſpite whereof they had rather endure all extremitie, then to acknowledge him to be head of the Church. And concerning the vnion of charitie amongſt them which yet cleaue to the Pope, there is nothing more deare vnto them, then their own liues, &amp; we haue bene put to the fire, water &amp; ſword, for opening the trueth vnto them, &amp; praying God euery day, that he wil enlighten them by his ſpirit. On the other ſide, the Romiſh Conſiſtory doth purſue vs by al meanes to death, and that by the ſpace of theſe three ſcore yeeres and more, and ſo many people continually groning for a free generall Council, they haue not had onely ſo much charitie, as to grant vs eyther generall or nationall, to deliuer vs from the error they pretend vs to be in, anſwering for al (&amp; that to ſo many princes, who haue iudged it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary) That theſe matters are already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, and ought not any more to come in queſtion. this is euery way a friuolous an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, as wee haue ſhewed before. But I demaunde, what Parliament is it, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen amongſt the heathen, ſo barbarous,
<pb facs="tcp:7934:173"/>and ſo farre from humanitie, which for the agreeing of two perſons onely, woulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to handle againe a proceſſe, whereof there had bene a determinate ſentence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the Parliament before?

To be ſhort, we agree and are knitte together in the doctrine of the Bible, with all Chriſtians, but we reiect the peſtilent gloſes and traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Pope: we haue bene willing brotherly to communicate the trueth to our brethren, with the danger of our life, in the middeſt of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: and contrarywiſe the Pope, in ſtead of hearkening vnto vs, fearing to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, hath excommunicated, chaſed and driuen vs out. It is therfore the Pope and his greaſie ones, which haue broken the Communion of the vniuerſall Church, &amp; not we, who to keepe vs in, are readie to ſubmitte our ſelues to al reaſon, &amp; to abide all dangers.<note place="margin">Altar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, that they alledge altar againſt
<pb facs="tcp:7934:173"/>altar, if we ſhall conſider the nature of the Chriſtian Church, it is not much from the purpoſe. In auncient tyme vnder the law,<note place="margin">Exod. 29.</note> there was but one Temple, and one altar, without which they were forbidden to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: whereupon we ſee yet, that the Iewes which were ſcattered throughout the world, myght not ſacrifice. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe which ſet vp altars in Dan and Bethel, albeit that they had not ſacrificed but to the true God, and according to the ſacrifices ordayned in the lawe, yet they were guiltie of death, becauſe they had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the expreſſe ordinaunce of God, who woulde haue obedience and not ſacrifice: and becauſe that in Ieſus Chriſt to come, figured by one citie of Hieruſalem, by one Temple, and by one altar, they ought to withdrawe themſelues from the ſocietie of all other people. This is the cauſe, that we reade not that the Prophetes eſtabliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny order of the ſeruice of God in any other place, although that the Temple of Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem were defiled with idolatrie, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they preached ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly againſt thoſe which mayntained it, &amp; yet without ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing any where elſe. But by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming
<pb facs="tcp:7934:174"/>of Ieſus Chriſt, as we haue often ſayde, it is altogether otherwyſe. For all the worlde is Hieruſalem, the temple, and the altar of the Lorde. We pray not any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger towardes the Eaſt: but on euery ſide to which we turne vs, wee turne to God, we looke alwayes to Ieſus Chriſt. When therefore the Apoſtles preaching Chriſt, coulde not be receyued into Hieruſalem preaching Chriſt in the temple, they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him in houſes, and when they were yet dryuen away, they ſhooke of the duſte of their feete, in witneſſe agaynſt them, and went and preached elſe where. When alſo they were forewarned by the holie Ghoſt, of Gods vengeance to come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Citie that had crucified Chriſt the anoynted, they made no difficultie, ſayeth Euſebius,<note place="margin">Euſeb. in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor.

And this is the cauſe, why (being forbidden by kings and Princes vpon payne of rebellion to preache in Temples, agaynſt the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie which is there committed, and agayne beyng likewyſe expreſſely commaunded by God to auoyde Idoles, and to publiſhe the trueth) wee haue gathered the true faithfull thyther, where we myght ſerue God together, according to his worde, and we haue withdrawen Hieruſalem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the towne of Pella, by the example of the Apoſtles, and according to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie which Ieſus Chriſt hath gyuen to the Vniuerſall Church. But by ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ſelues from Rome, we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned in the heauenly Ieruſalem, founded vpon the doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, from which it hath ſeparated it ſelfe, and wee haue not buylt an altar
<pb facs="tcp:7934:175"/>againſt the altar of the Lorde (for Rome is not the peculiar ſeate of the Lords altar) but rather an altar of Chriſt againſt the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of Antichriſt, a temple of lyuing ſtones founded vpon the chiefe maſter ſtone of the corner, agaynſt the temples of idoles, buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the ſtone of offence, which is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. There is therefore a notable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene Hierualem and Rome: and conſequently it is one thing to ſeparat from the faction of Rome, that can hardly deſerue the name of a member, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from the Catholique and Vniuerſall Church. Hieruſalem was the Temple of the Lord, and at this day the whole worlde is his Temple: in compariſon of which, Rome is nothing. To Hieruſalem was promiſed the Sonne of God, to Rome the ſonne of perdition. And from this peculiar Temple of God, the Apoſtles withdrewe themſelues, for that it refuſed ſaluation, yea that they myght not periſhe in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, they remoued the Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another place. From the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication or fellowſhippe therefore of the Church of Rome, which worſhippeth and vpholdeth perdition, wee holde our ſelues bounde to

Nowe wee will not bee more ſcrupulous then Moyſes. Let them ſuffer vs to beate their Idols to powder, &amp; to caſt Idolatrie out of their Church, and we will aſke no better, to remaine ſtill with them. They will yet further reproch vs, that Chriſt haunted the temple notwithſtanding the marchandize that was there committed: there is a great difference betweene the marchandize that was there, and the idolatrie that at this day hath place in the Church of Rome.

Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but ſuffer vs to preach in theyr Churches amongſt theyr Idols, we wil make them to fal downe at the only worde of God, without euer touching or laying hande vpon them.

But we can not come there and holde our peace: for accurſed is he, which heareth his God blaſphemed, without proteſting againſt it, and ſeeth his brother deceyued, and doeth not direct him.

               <p>Thirdly, baptiſme in our infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie brought vs into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe of God, but it is not enough to be receyued into his familie, if we ſerue him not according to his commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. For then we depriue our ſelues of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite receyued by baptiſme, the which (as S. Auguſtine ſayeth) is turned into our greater condemnation. This therefore is vnto vs as the law of nature in a common weale, which bindeth vs to the duetie of good citizens: &amp; of ſimple &amp; plaine enemies that we ſhoulde be, we become traytors, and parricides, if we ſerue a Tyrant which hath inuaded it,<note place="margin">Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides are they that kill their owne pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and kinſfolks.</note> and if we beare armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lawes thereof. For albeit we be borne vnder tyrannie, yet we are borne for the common weale, and enrouled in the Regiſter of Citizens, &amp; not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in the liſts of the tyrants ſlaues, yea euen though the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or his officers keepe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Regiſter. Now to the Citizen, which is borne vnder tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who hath ſerued a tyrant, &amp; who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes acknowledging his fault, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe to the defenders of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon libertie, there is no neede of newe letters of his naturall birth, although by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer deedes, he made himſelfe vnworthie.
<pb facs="tcp:7934:181"/>So likewiſe we ſay, that to him which is bound vnder the popedom, who hath main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Antichriſt, and ioyned himſelfe to his faction, and to euery other Heritique, which hath fought againſt Chriſt, there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no ſecond Baptiſme, when he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to his dutie. For albeit he had renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Chriſt, yet Chriſt hath not renounced the right he hath ouer him, and his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is ſo little defaced, that of a ſimple e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy which he ſhould haue bin w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, he is become a traitor, and guiltie of hie treaſon againſt his maieſtie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there needeth nothing but an vtter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhment of his fault, and not a renuing of his baptiſme.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. Yea, but there is no baptiſme but in the Church, and when you ſeparate your ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, you then ſeparate your ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the church. The anſwere. There is no Baptiſme but in the Church, and we deny not alſo, that the Church of Rome is a Church. For in that we affirme that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ruleth there, we conſequently hold y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is the Churche, inaſmuch as he can not ſit any where but in the Church.

                  <note place="margin">The cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the firſt refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of the Church in our time.</note>If therefore our aduerſaries aſke vs, what was the calling of our firſt Miniſters, which refourmed the Church in theſe laſt times, we anſwere that it was the ſame vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſucceſſion, whereof they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues doe bragge: but the ſame vocation which they abuſed, our men haue endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to vſe will, and to that vaine ſucceſſion wherewith they decked themſelues, they haue added the ſucceſſion of true doctrine, which they had corrupted: without which all ſucceſſion is nothing els, but a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of abuſe and error. Wickleife, Iohn Hus, Luther, Zwinglius, Decolompadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Bucer, and others of that ſchoole (from whence the Miniſters which haue gathered Churches from vnder Antichriſt, are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended) were Prieſts (as they cal them) and doctors in diuinitie. As Prieſts &amp; Paſtors, they had charge to preach y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth vnto the people, &amp; to miniſter the Sacraments vnto them, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Lord. As doctors, they were called to expound di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie
<pb facs="tcp:7934:185"/>in their readings, &amp; in theyr bookes, and they were bounde by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordinary othe of al vniuerſities, to declare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth vnto the Church, to confute al doctrines repugnant againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God, and what then might to expell it. Now in their time, they found y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God was hid vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people: that the honor which was due to God alone, was turned to men, &amp; to Images: that the blood of Chriſt was troden vnder foote: that the ſacrament of the ſupper was partly turned into Idolatry, &amp; partly denyed to the poore people. To be ſhort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all the holy ſcripture was prophaned &amp; poyſoned with the Popes gloſes, &amp; popiſh interpretations. And when they ſhewed theſe thinges to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Biſhops and Metropolitans, according to the order of their Church, they made no rekoning of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they were the firſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> perſecuted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe they themſelues were the infected parte of the Church. I aſke therefore, if theyr vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation commaunded them not to goe far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to witte, to preach the trueth vnto the people, and purely to adminiſter the holy Sacraments? And if they had done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe, whether they had not bin forſakers of theyr calling, contenmers of theyr othe
<pb facs="tcp:7934:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>made vnto God, and abuſers of the people? Both two therefore, (ſay I) both our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and our firſt miniſters had one and the ſame ordinarie &amp; outward calling. But herein is the difference, that that which ours haue followed, the other haue forſaken: that which ours haue done of duetie by reaſon of their charge, the other haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealed. Ours haue ledde their ſheepe vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mountaines of Iſrael into good paſtures:<note place="margin">Ezech. 34.</note> the others haue deuoured them, or els left them for a pray to the beaſtes of the field, or els driuen them to the fennes and mariſhes where they haue ſtarued. A magiſtrate ſhall be called to the gouernment of a common wealth, where he ſhall finde the good lawes corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the negligence or malice of thoſe that went before, his Courts full of iniuſtice, the offices ſubiect to factions, briberies and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions: and he would reforme all this, and bring it to the cenſure of the lawes. He that will further nowe aſke him, by what right he doth this, ſhould he not make him ſelf a laughing ſtocke, becauſe he followeth ſteppe by ſteppe his calling? He hath not ſworne to mainteyne abuſes, but rather to mainteyne the lawes, and to prouide euery
<pb facs="tcp:7934:186"/>way that he can, for the good and preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Common wealth. Nowe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe, if he wincke at that which is euil, he ſhould doe directly contrary to his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Euen ſo likewiſe haue our firſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters done, firſt requiring reformation, and afterwards putting to their handes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their duetie. And if we could aſke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles, who are their true ſucceſſors: they would not tel vs, Such as haue a triple crowne, or ſuch a cope, or ſuch a miter, but thoſe that preach the word of God after our example. For ſo had they learned of the true maſter,<note place="margin">Matth. 1.</note> That he which doth the wil of God his father, is his mother, his ſiſter and his brother. At the preaching of theſe firſt men, the paſtors of the Churches were awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in England, in Bohemia, in Germanie, in Scotland, in Denmarke, in Sweden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and afterwardes many in Fraunce, in Spaine, and in Italie it ſelfe, and theſe were ſent to bethinke them of their duetie. Conſequently ſome whole Realmes were reformed: the biſhops themſelues, that there had preached lyes, preached the trueth in the ſelfe ſame Church &amp; pulpit. Of theſe for the moſt part, if our aduerſaries will demaund
<pb facs="tcp:7934:187"/>ſucceſſion, it is on their ſide, for they haue ſucceeded from biſhop to biſhop, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt which preached there the Goſpell. If they aſke a vocation, why, it is euen their owne: for they were called to be biſhopps and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and they haue performed the office, which they had forſaken. The difference therefore, as we haue ſaid, is in this onely point, that they feede the people with peſcod ſhales, and the others in the paſture of life: they defile their flockes with the filthineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Antichriſt, and theſe waſh them in the blood of Ieſus Chriſt. Beholde then, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the calling of our firſt Miniſters, which hath whatſoeuer may be good, in the pretended calling of our aduerſaries: and this point further: That our men lawfully exerciſe it, and the other do but withhold it in vnrighteouſneſſe. And although ſome of our men, as in ſo corrupt a ſtate of the Church (as we haue ſeene it in our time) without wayting for their calling, or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them that vnder the title of paſtors, oppreſſed the Lords flocke, were called by thoſe Churches, to which they vowed their miniſtery: yet this ought no more to be thought ſtraunge, then in a free common
<pb facs="tcp:7934:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>wealth, where the people without wayting either for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conſent or voyces of thoſe that playe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyrants, ſhal haue choſen according to the lawes, good and lawful magiſtrates.</p>

To be ſhort, the firſt Biſhops of the Chriſtian Church were but elders: and our firſt miniſters were el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: &amp; the elders by the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, had authoritie to lay on their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, according to which alſo ours were ordeined: miniſters therefore ordeined by them are well ordained, and their vocation can not in any wiſe be cauilled at, or ſlaundered. Nowe if any thinke them contemptible in compariſon of the great prelates of the Church of Rome: Caiphas in deede was reuecenced of the worlde, whereas Cephas had neither golde nor ſiluer. Paul being a perſecuter, was in great credit, and Paul
<pb facs="tcp:7934:192"/>being an Apoſtle, gotte his liuing with his owne hands. Alſo, God is wont to confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the great and mightie things of the world, through thinges which ſeeme ſmall. And many of ours followe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pouertie of Chriſt, which might be honoured, yea and were ſo ſometimes, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the chiefe vpholders of Antichriſt.

But if he caſt out deuils, this was (ſay they) by the power of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil.

               <p>When the Lawe was publiſhed by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we reade that then he wrought mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. When there was a matter of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo betwixt God and Baal, God wrought miracles by Elias. But when Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias the king, &amp; Helkias the Prieſt brought foorth the booke of the Lawe, which had bene buried eyther by the negligence or malice of the teachers, and that they threw
<pb facs="tcp:7934:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>out the idoles which men had brought into the Temple of God: when Eſdras the Scribe and Prieſt reſtored the ſeruice of God, after the captiuitie of Babylon, we reade not that they wrought any miracles: the reaſon thereof is very cleare. Moſes had publiſhed a newe Lawe to the people. And Elias had to do with a people, that openly had renounced the lawe. Contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Ioſias, Helkias, &amp; Eſdras onely kept the lawe, and according to that reformed the Church, and had to do with a people that beleeued, and would yeeld vnto it: yea, with a people who were taught by the lawe, to beleeue the lawe againſt all miracles.<note place="margin">Deut. 13.</note> In like maner when Chriſt brought the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, he wrought miracles: but we finde not when any paſtor of the Church hath required the reformation of ſome abuſes of the Councilles which entred therein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that hee was requeſted to worke mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Of Saynt Bernarde, who cryed ſo lowde agaynſt the corruption of his time, and who ſighed ſo ſore after the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Churche, they aſked none.

<pb facs="tcp:7934:195"/>ſo long agoe is entred into al things.

For we preache nothing but ſaluation in one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ieſus Chriſt, confirmed by the miracles of Chriſte, and of his Apoſtles. But it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to Antichriſt to do them, who prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth ſaluation by mans works, by monkes merites, and by his owne indulgences and pardons, who hath brought vs in a newe Chriſt, and a newe Goſpel, which the deuil hath confirmed and ſealed to the worlde, by ſtraunge ſignes &amp; wonders, &amp; lying mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, whereof all oratories &amp; Chappels not long ſithens boaſted &amp; vaunted: which when Chriſte was borne, vaniſhed altogether to nothing, as he made the oracles of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil to do when he was borne into the world. And I aſke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nowe of their conſcience, if we came w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> miracles, whether our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries would beleeue our Doctrine, which nowe ſo boldely they condemne to the fyre? If they ſaye, No: why then, they abuſe the
<pb facs="tcp:7934:196"/>people, when they aſke vs for them, as though without miracles our Doctrine ought not to be receyued, and as though they were by and by ready, if we had theſe, quietly to allowe it. If they ſaye they would, we ought not then to marueil, if agaynſt Chriſte, they haue receyued Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, ſeeing the deuill hath authorized him by his miracles, foraſmuch as all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were forewarned by the ſpirite of God,<note place="margin">2.

               <p>Nowe if they wil yet ſtiffely holde an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of miracles, one poore Fryer, with the onely ſounde of the woorde of God, hath in one moment ſhaken al the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Babylonical Empire, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be ſo well fenſed againſt all the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the time.

With the ayde of a fewe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and of the ſame eſtate, he hath withdrawen the greateſt parte of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome from vnder his power: he hath deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this deuill that poſſeſſed them, not only me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or cities, but euen whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: he hath by the word of God opened the eyes of a thouſand millions of perſons, that were blinde, euen from their birth. And although the only word of God preached by his ſeruaunts, hath done theſe great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiles, you yet denie that God worketh mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. Yea rather this is the miracle of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, that this great miracle is wrought without miracles. We haue ſeene in our time many Bethulias, many Senacheribs, many Herodes, and many Diocleſians. We haue ſeene Gyants daſhed againſt the

And who would haue ſaid, I pray you, that after the <hi>24.</hi> day of Auguſt in the yere <hi>1572.</hi> that euer there ſhoulde againe any mention be made of vs in Fraunce? We were as dead &amp; buried, they had rolled ſuch a great ſtone vpon vs, to keepe vs downe: on euery ſide they were in armes about our graues. God contrariwiſe from all theſe ſame lets, reſtored vs life to praiſe him: and to make all the earth aſhamed in their ſlie purpoſes, he woulde that euen the aduerſaries of our religion them ſelues ſhould remoue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtone, and reaching out their hands vnto vs, ſhould drawe vs out of the graue againe. Nowe, if as the Phariſes, they will yet aſke vs for a ſigne from heauen, then during the time that theſe horrible murthers continued tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe out Fraunce, there began to appeare in the firmament this newe ſtarre, whereof ſithens the creation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world the like hath not bene ſeene, but at the birth of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.

The ſtarre which was followed of the wiſe men, was thirtie yeeres before it ſhewed his effect: and when that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect was accompliſhed, it was by the fleſhe of one man, of whom me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made no accompt, and by the ſhame of a croſſe, that ſeemed to haue encloſed the whole Diuinitie in one Tombe. Notwithſtanding, after that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel had caſt out his fire againſt the Apoſtles and diſciples of Chriſt, &amp; that he had rayſed againſt them infinite perſecutions, it muſt needes be in the end that he yelde himſelfe, &amp; that al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth acknowledge their Lord.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Church is conſidered, as it is to be ſeene, or not to be ſeene.</p>
               <p>The Church not to be ſeene, is the companie of thoſe whom God hath choſen to euerlaſting life, in all times and places.</p>
               <p>The Church that is to be ſeene, is the company of thoſe, who are called thereinto, and is conſidered according to certaine times and places.</p>
               <p>There is notwithſtanding but one Church, but conſidered diuerſely: In that which is to be ſeene, as the corne with the chaſſe: in that which is not to be ſeene, as the corne threſhed and fanned.</p>
               <p>This viſible Church was firſt without the law, afterwards vnder the law, tyed to one certain place &amp; familie. Now through grace it is ſpred through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, one place hauing no more priuiledge then an other, whereof it is called Catholike, that is to ſay, vniuerſall.</p>
               <p>The Catholike Church comprehendeth vnder it all aſſemblies of Chriſtians, in al regions, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we call Churches, as we call partes of the ſea, the ſea: diſtinguiſhing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> notwithſtanding by their names, as the Church of Greece, of Affrike &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Of the parts of the Church, as the members of the ſame body, yea though it be vniuerſall, ſome are pure and ſome impure, and of thoſe that are impure, ſome are more and ſome leſſe impure.</p>
               <p>The pure Churches are thoſe, in which the word of God is purely preached, and the ſacraments du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adminiſtred, albeit that in reſpect of God there is nothing pure. The one they call the ſound and true Churches, the other (but unproperly) Catholike Churches.</p>
               <p>The impure are thoſe, in which the word of God, and his ſacraments are ill adminiſtred, whatſoeuer
<pb facs="tcp:7934:199" rendition="simple:additions"/>other outward marckes they can pretende.</p>
               <p>And becauſe that al the doctrine of Chriſt is faith and charitie, we cal thoſe that are impure in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of faith, heretical Churches, and thoſe that haue ſeparated themſelues from the vnitie, which they do through lacke of charitie, Schiſmatical.</p>
               <p>And ſome there are, that are both heretical and Schiſmatical, as the Churche of Rome, and they that at this day cleaue vnto it: for they maintaine many damnable hereſies, and perſecute and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate thoſe that deſire reformation. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding foraſmuch as the profeſſion of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth there in ſome ſorte, we denie them not the name of a Church, as we call a man, a man, howe ſicke or braineleſſe ſoeuer he be.</p>
               <p>To diſcerne the pure churches fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the impure, God hath deliuered vs his worde contained in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the which is perfect &amp; cleere to ſaluation: for it hath for his aucthor, the moſt perfect father of light.</p>
               <p>This is that therfore, by which men ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies of this time, &amp; to reforme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> welth according to the lawes, aboliſhing that, which God hath there forbidden vs, holding that for forbidden in his ſeruice, which hee hath not ordeined, looking to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, and interpreting his wil by it ſelfe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thoſe thinges that are in controuerſie.</p>
               <p>The Churches which follow that wil, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not erre, for that is the way of ſaluation, and following that, God guideth them alſo by his ſpirit which enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them, and is inſeparably ioyned thereto.</p>
               <p>Contrariwiſe, the Churches which departe from it, may, and doe erre, yea and that in the matter of ſaluation, for that they goe out of the way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Neither can they beaſt of the ſpirite: for God beſtoweth it not but vpon his ſheepe, neither
<pb facs="tcp:7934:199" rendition="simple:additions"/>doth he hold any for his ſheepe, but thoſe that heare his voyce.</p>
               <p>Therfore the Church following mans fantaſie, &amp; not the lawe of God, hath greatly erred in all her particular ſtates &amp; times, euen vntil the crucifiyng of the ſonne of God, that is to ſay, her owne ſaluation: As in our time we ſay that the Church of Rome doth adore and worſhip the ſonne of perdition, that is to ſay, Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>The Church is a body, &amp; Chriſt the ſonne of God is the head thereof, giuing efficacie to the Miniſterie of his Goſpell, through his ſpirit, &amp; by the ſelfe ſame aſſiſting all thoſe that truely call vpon him. And this is that wherein conſiſteth the adminiſtration or gouernement of the head of the Church.</p>
               <p>And as touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſterial head, no man may be it. For the Church, by the comming of Chriſt, is ſpread throughout the whole world, &amp; none can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe that miniſterie throughout the world: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euery paſtor repreſenteth Chriſt in his charge.</p>
               <p>And in deede our ſauiour Chriſt before he aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into heauen ordeyned none ſuch, neither did any of the Apoſtles exerciſe any ſuch office, &amp; the whole primitiue Church neuer knewe of it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, following the worde of God and the opinion of the ſame church, we hold that the Papal See, which vnder this falſe title exerciſeth tyranny ouer all the world, is Antichriſt, the which without other proofes and circumſtances, may be verified by his doctrine alone.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding that this Papal See, placed in one part of the Church, is not the Churche, neither a part of the Church, but as a peſtilence to the body of the Church, which hath corrupted and infected all aſmuch as it coulde, and had vtterly choked it, without the ſpecial mercie of God.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7934:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>We doe therefore depart from the papacie, and not from the Church, from Idoles, and not from the temple, from Tyranme, and not from the common wealth, from the plague, and not from the Citie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready, entirely to knit and ioyne our ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, when Antichriſt, &amp; the euil which he hath brought in, ſhalbe taken away.</p>
               <p>And in waiting for this we reforme the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the worde of God, and as nye as we can, his ſeruice, according to his inſtitution, by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Apoſtles excommunicated out of Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, which yet notwithſtanding is not to buyld al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar againſt altar, for by Chriſt his comming all the earth is made the Lordes altar.</p>
               <p>Our miniſters, who haue begonne this woorke, haue the ſame calling that our aduerſaries pretend: for they were elders and doctors ordeined as they were, and by them, and they haue done nothing, but followed their calling, whereas the others had vtterly abandoned it.</p>
               <p>And they which followed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afterwards, had a much better calling then our aduerſaries: for beſides that they were ordeyned by thoſe firſt, who had authoritie to do it, they were ordeined according to the practiſe of the Apoſtles and auncient Canons, which are neglected in the Church of Rome.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, beſides this ordinarie vocation, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie wonders, which God hath wrought, in theſe laſt times by their Miniſtery, &amp; in the fauour thereof, maye ſufficiently witneſſe that they do the worke of God, and not of men.</p>
